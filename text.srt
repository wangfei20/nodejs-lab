CHAPTER ONE

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,520
THE BOY WHO LIVED

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,200
Mr. and Mrs. Dursley,

4
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,240
of number four,

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,200
Privet Drive,

6
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,880
were proud to say that they were perfectly normal,

7
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,280
thank you very much.

8
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,960
They were the last people you'd expect to be 
involved in anything strange or mysterious,

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,720
because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,800
Mr. Dursley was the director 
of a firm called Grunnings,

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,080
which made drills.

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,120
He was a big,

13
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,280
beefy man with hardly any neck,

14
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,840
although he did have a very large mustache.

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,320
Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had 
nearly twice the usual amount of neck,

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,000
which came in very useful as she spent so 
much of her time craning over garden fences,

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,480
spying on the neighbors.

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,600
The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,600
and in their opinion there 
was no finer boy anywhere.

20
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,680
The Dursleys had everything they wanted,

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,440
but they also had a secret,

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,480
and their greatest fear was 
that somebody would discover it.

23
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,120
They didn't think they could bear it 
if anyone found out about the Potters.

24
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,640
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister,

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,680
but they hadn't met for several years;

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,360
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended 
she didn't have a sister,

27
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,800
because her sister and her 
good-for-nothing husband  

28
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,560
were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,800
The Dursleys shuddered to think

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,080
what the neighbors would say if 
the Potters arrived in the street.

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,680
The Dursleys knew that the 
Potters had a small son,

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,280
too, but they had never even seen him.

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,440
This boy was another good reason 
for keeping the Potters away;

34
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,160
they didn't want Dudley 
mixing with a child like that.

35
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,760
When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull,

36
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,800
gray Tuesday our story starts,

37
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,280
there was nothing about the cloudy 
sky outside to suggest that strange

38
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
and mysterious things would soon 
be happening all over the country.

39
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,400
Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked 
out his most boring tie for work,

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,520
and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she 
wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.

41
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,200
None of them noticed a large, 
tawny owl flutter past the window.

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,400
At half past eight,

43
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,440
Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase,

44
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,280
pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek,

45
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,720
and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,

46
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,400
because Dudley was now having a tantrum 
and throwing his cereal at the walls.

47
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
"Little tyke,"

48
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,760
chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house.

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,320
He got into his car and backed 
out of number four's drive.

50
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,680
It was on the corner of the street that he 
noticed the first sign of something peculiar ,

51
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,240
a cat reading a map.

52
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,160
For a second,

53
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,600
Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen ,

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,800
then he jerked his head around to look again.

55
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,960
There was a tabby cat standing 
on the corner of Privet Drive,

56
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,840
but there wasn't a map in sight.

57
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,440
What could he have been thinking of?

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,200
It must have been a trick of the light.

59
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,720
Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat.

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
It stared back.

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,080
As Mr. Dursley drove around 
the corner and up the road,

62
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,960
he watched the cat in his mirror.

63
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,680
It was now reading the sign 
that said Privet Drive ,

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
no, looking at the sign;

65
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,440
cats couldn't read maps or signs.

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
Mr. Dursley gave himself a little 
shake and put the cat out of his mind.

67
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,920
As he drove toward town he thought of nothing 
except a large order of drills he was hoping

68
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,040
to get that day.

69
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,200
But on the edge of town,

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,040
drills were driven out of 
his mind by something else.

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam,

72
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,880
he couldn't help noticing that there seemed 
to be a lot of strangely dressed people about.

73
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,280
People in cloaks.

74
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,320
Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people 
who dressed in funny clothes ,

75
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,440
the getups you saw on young people!

76
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,960
He supposed this was some stupid new fashion.

77
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,880
He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel

78
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,840
and his eyes fell on a huddle of 
these weirdos standing quite close by.

79
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,160
They were whispering excitedly together.

80
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,120
Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a 
couple of them weren't young at all;

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,520
why, that man had to be older than he was,

82
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,560
and wearing an emerald-green cloak!

83
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,640
The nerve of him!

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,240
But then it struck Mr. Dursley that 
this was probably some silly stunt ,

85
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:35,120
these people were obviously 
collecting for something...

86
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,640
yes, that would be it.

87
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
The traffic moved on and a few minutes later,

88
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot,

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,800
his mind back on drills.

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,320
Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the 
window in his office on the ninth floor.

91
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,080
If he hadn't,

92
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,520
he might have found it harder to 
concentrate on drills that morning.

93
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,520
He didn't see the owls swoop 
ing past in broad daylight,

94
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,440
though people down in the street did;

95
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,280
they pointed and gazed open- mouthed 
as owl after owl sped overhead.

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,120
Most of them had never seen 
an owl even at nighttime.

97
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
Mr. Dursley,

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,000
however, had a perfectly normal,

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,200
owl-free morning.

100
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,240
He yelled at five different people.

101
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,760
He made several important telephone 
calls and shouted a bit more.

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,280
He was in a very good mood until lunchtime,

103
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,760
when he thought he'd stretch his legs

104
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,080
and walk across the road to buy 
himself a bun from the bakery.

105
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,520
He'd forgotten all about the people

106
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,880
in cloaks until he passed a group 
of them next to the baker's.

107
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,840
He eyed them angrily as he passed.

108
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,880
He didn't know why,

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,520
but they made him uneasy.

110
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,320
This bunch were whispering excitedly,

111
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,400
too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin.

112
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,160
It was on his way back past them,

113
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,240
clutching a large doughnut in a bag,

114
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,720
that he caught a few words 
of what they were saying.

115
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,600
"The Potters,

116
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,360
that's right,

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,240
that's what I heard yes,

118
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,800
their son, Harry"

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,480
Mr. Dursley stopped dead.

120
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,640
Fear flooded him.

121
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,360
He looked back at the whisperers as 
if he wanted to say something to them,

122
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,720
but thought better of it.

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,640
He dashed back across the road,

124
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,040
hurried up to his office,

125
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,520
snapped at his secretary not to disturb him,

126
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,960
seized his telephone,

127
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,760
and had almost finished dialing his 
home number when he changed his mind.

128
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,720
He put the receiver back down 
and stroked his mustache,

129
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,360
thinking...

130
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,280
no, he was being stupid.

131
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,480
Potter wasn't such an unusual name.

132
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,480
He was sure there were lots of people 
called Potter who had a son called Harry.

133
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,520
Come to think of it,

134
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,200
he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry.

135
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,920
He'd never even seen the boy.

136
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,400
It might have been Harvey. Or Harold.

137
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,680
There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley;

138
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,000
she always got so upset at 
any mention of her sister.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,160
He didn't blame her ,

140
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,440
if he'd had a sister like that...

141
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
but all the same,

142
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
those people in cloaks...

143
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,880
He found it a lot harder to concentrate 
on drills that afternoon and

144
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,520
when he left the building at five o'clock,

145
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,720
he was still so worried that he walked 
straight into someone just outside the door.

146
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,240
"Sorry,"

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,960
he grunted,

148
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,760
as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell.

149
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,880
It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized 
that the man was wearing a violet cloak.

150
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,640
He didn't seem at all upset at 
being almost knocked to the ground.

151
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,440
On the contrary,

152
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,720
his face split into a wide smile and he said 
in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare,

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,840
"Don't be sorry,

154
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
my dear sir,

155
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,800
for nothing could upset me today!

156
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,400
Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last!

157
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,800
Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating,

158
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,560
this happy,

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,440
happy day!"

160
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,200
And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley 
around the middle and walked off.

161
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,480
Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot.

162
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,920
He had been hugged by a complete stranger.

163
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,960
He also thought he had been called a Muggle,

164
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,080
whatever that was.

165
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,200
He was rattled.

166
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,800
He hurried to his car and set off for home,

167
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,640
hoping he was imagining things,

168
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,440
which he had never hoped before,

169
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,320
because he didn't approve of imagination.

170
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,680
As he pulled into the driveway of number four,

171
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,400
the first thing he saw ,

172
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,120
and it didn't improve his mood ,

173
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,480
was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning.

174
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,640
It was now sitting on his garden wall.

175
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,240
He was sure it was the same one;

176
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,680
it had the same markings around its eyes.

177
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,320
"Shoo!"

178
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,080
said Mr. Dursley loudly.

179
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,440
The cat didn't move.

180
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,200
It just gave him a stern look.

181
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,680
Was this normal cat behavior?

182
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,080
Mr. Dursley wondered.

183
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,720
Trying to pull himself together,

184
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,640
he let himself into the house.

185
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,960
He was still determined not to 
mention anything to his wife.

186
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,600
Mrs. Dursley had had a nice,

187
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,600
normal day.

188
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,600
She told him over dinner all about Mrs. 
Next Door's problems with her daughter and

189
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,380
how Dudley had learned a new word (

190
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:19,760
"Won't!" ).

191
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,880
Mr. Dursley tried to act normally.

192
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,560
When Dudley had been put to bed,

193
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,000
he went into the living room in time to 
catch the last report on the evening news:

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,720
"And finally,

195
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,600
bird-watchers everywhere have reported

196
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,160
that the nation's owls have been 
behaving very unusually today.

197
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,120
Although owls normally hunt at night 
and are hardly ever seen in daylight,

198
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,640
there have been hundreds of 
sightings of these birds flying

199
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,000
in every direction since sunrise.

200
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,560
Experts are unable to explain why the owls 
have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern."

201
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,960
The newscaster allowed himself a grin.

202
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,440
"Most mysterious.

203
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,000
And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather.

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,960
Going to be any more showers of owls tonight,

205
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,720
Jim?"

206
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,640
"Well, Ted,"

207
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,800
said the weatherman,

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,240
"I don't know about that,

209
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,200
but it's not only the owls that 
have been acting oddly today.

210
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,160
Viewers as far apart as Kent,

211
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,080
Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell 
me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday,

212
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,440
they've had a downpour of shooting stars!

213
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,360
Perhaps people have been 
celebrating Bonfire Night early ,

214
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,760
it's not until next week, folks!

215
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,080
But I can promise a wet night tonight."

216
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,600
Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair.

217
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,440
Shooting stars all over Britain?

218
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,240
Owls flying by daylight?

219
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,880
Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place?

220
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,880
And a whisper,

221
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,040
a whisper about the Potters...

222
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:35,640
Mrs. Dursley came into the living 
room carrying two cups of tea.

223
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,760
It was no good.

224
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,560
He'd have to say something to her.

225
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,480
He cleared his throat nervously.

226
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,800
"Er , Petunia,

227
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:44,520
dear , you haven't heard from your sister lately,

228
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,240
have you?"

229
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,480
As he had expected,

230
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,920
Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry.

231
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,280
After all, they normally pretended 
she didn't have a sister.

232
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:52,680
"No,"

233
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,080
she said sharply.

234
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,640
"Why?"

235
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,880
"Funny stuff on the news,"

236
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,080
Mr. Dursley mumbled. "Owls...

237
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,720
shooting stars...

238
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,120
and there were a lot of funny-looking 
people in town today..."

239
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,560
"So?"

240
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,320
snapped Mrs. Dursley.

241
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,600
"Well, I just thought... maybe...

242
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,960
it was something to do with...

243
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,720
you know...

244
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,840
her crowd."

245
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,600
Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips.

246
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,680
Mr. Dursley wondered whether he 
dared tell her he'd heard the name

247
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,520
"Potter."

248
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,000
He decided he didn't dare. Instead 
he said, as casually as he could,

249
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,520
"Their son , he'd be about 
Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?"

250
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,560
"I suppose so,"

251
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.

252
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,920
"What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?"

253
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,480
"Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me."

254
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,840
"Oh, yes,"

255
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,680
said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly.

256
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,920
"Yes, I quite agree."

257
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,560
He didn't say another word on the 
subject as they went upstairs to bed.

258
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom,

259
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,840
Mr. Dursley crept to the bedroom window 
and peered down into the front garden.

260
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,240
The cat was still there.

261
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,880
It was staring down Privet Drive as 
though it were waiting for something.

262
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,480
Was he imagining things?

263
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,320
Could all this have anything 
to do with the Potters?

264
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,760
If it did...

265
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,320
if it got out that they 
were related to a pair of ,

266
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,400
well, he didn't think he could bear it.

267
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,120
The Dursleys got into bed.

268
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,600
Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly 
but Mr. Dursley lay awake,

269
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,560
turning it all over in his mind.

270
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,320
His last, comforting thought before he fell 
asleep was that even if the Potters were involved,

271
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,920
there was no reason for them to 
come near him and Mrs. Dursley.

272
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,280
The Potters knew very well what he and 
Petunia thought about them and their kind....

273
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,600
He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get 
mixed up in anything that might be going on ,

274
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,280
he yawned and turned over ,

275
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,880
it couldn't affect them....

276
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,520
How very wrong he was.

277
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,640
Mr. Dursley might have been 
drifting into an uneasy sleep,

278
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,040
but the cat on the wall outside 
was showing no sign of sleepiness.

279
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,000
It was sitting as still as a statue,

280
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,520
its eyes fixed unblinkingly on 
the far corner of Privet Drive.

281
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,960
It didn't so much as quiver when a 
car door slammed on the next street,

282
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,280
nor when two owls swooped overhead.

283
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,680
In fact, it was nearly midnight 
before the cat moved at all.

284
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,400
A man appeared on the corner 
the cat had been watching,

285
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,640
appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have 
thought he'd just popped out of the ground.

286
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,200
The cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.

287
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,360
Nothing like this man had ever 
been seen on Privet Drive.

288
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
He was tall,

289
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,040
thin, and very old,

290
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,480
judging by the silver of his hair and beard,

291
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,920
which were both long enough to tuck into his belt.

292
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,520
He was wearing long robes,

293
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,560
a purple cloak that swept the ground,

294
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
and high-heeled,

295
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,760
buckled boots.

296
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,360
His blue eyes were light,

297
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,240
bright, and sparkling behind half-moon spectacles 
and his nose was very long and crooked,

298
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,120
as though it had been broken at least twice.

299
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,480
This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.

300
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,280
Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to realize 
that he had just arrived in a street

301
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,160
where everything from his name 
to his boots was unwelcome.

302
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,080
He was busy rummaging in his cloak,

303
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,320
looking for something.

304
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,880
But he did seem to realize he was being watched,

305
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,000
because he looked up suddenly at the cat,

306
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,800
which was still staring at him 
from the other end of the street.

307
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,760
For some reason,

308
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,960
the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him.

309
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,240
He chuckled and muttered,

310
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,480
"I should have known."

311
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,280
He found what he was looking 
for in his inside pocket.

312
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,680
It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter.

313
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,880
He flicked it open,

314
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,080
held it up in the air,

315
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,160
and clicked it.

316
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,160
The nearest street lamp 
went out with a little pop.

317
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,280
He clicked it again ,

318
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,520
the next lamp flickered into darkness.

319
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,440
Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer,

320
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,800
until the only lights left on the whole street 
were two tiny pinpricks in the distance,

321
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,920
which were the eyes of the cat watching him.

322
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,720
If anyone looked out of their window now,

323
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,440
even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley,

324
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,960
they wouldn't be able to see anything 
that was happening down on the pavement.

325
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,680
Dumbledore slipped the 
Put-Outer back inside his cloak

326
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,240
and set off down the street toward number four,

327
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,760
where he sat down on the wall next to the cat.

328
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,880
He didn't look at it,

329
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,000
but after a moment he spoke to it.

330
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,760
"Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall."

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,440
He turned to smile at the tabby,

332
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,640
but it had gone.

333
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,320
Instead he was smiling at a 
rather severe-looking woman

334
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,840
who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape

335
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,440
of the markings the cat had had around its eyes.

336
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,200
She, too, was wearing a cloak,

337
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,360
an emerald one.

338
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,680
Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun.

339
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,440
She looked distinctly ruffled.

340
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,600
"How did you know it was me?" she asked.

341
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,000
"My dear Professor, I 've never 
seen a cat sit so stiffly."

342
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,760
"You'd be stiff if you'd been 
sitting on a brick wall all day,"

343
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,360
said Professor McGonagall. "All day?

344
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,000
When you could have been celebrating?

345
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,280
I must have passed a dozen feasts 
and parties on my way here."

346
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,560
Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

347
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,960
"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,"

348
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,400
she said impatiently.

349
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,960
"You'd think they'd be a bit more careful,

350
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,360
but no , even the Muggles have 
noticed something's going on.

351
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,640
It was on their news."

352
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,040
She jerked her head back at the 
Dursleys' dark living-room window.

353
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,920
"I heard it.

354
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,000
Flocks of owls...

355
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,280
shooting stars....

356
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,520
Well, they're not completely stupid.

357
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,120
They were bound to notice something.

358
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,920
Shooting stars down in Kent ,

359
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,760
I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle.

360
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,400
He never had much sense."

361
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,520
"You can't blame them,"

362
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,120
said Dumbledore gently.

363
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,240
"We've had precious little to 
celebrate for eleven years."

364
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,080
"I know that,"

365
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,360
said Professor McGonagall irritably.

366
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,520
"But that's no reason to lose our heads.

367
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,440
People are being downright careless,

368
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,040
out on the streets in broad daylight,

369
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,520
not even dressed in Muggle clothes,

370
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,920
swapping rumors."

371
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,160
She threw a sharp,

372
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,240
sideways glance at Dumbledore here,

373
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,400
as though hoping he was 
going to tell her something,

374
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,320
but he didn't,

375
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,640
so she went on.

376
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,040
"A fine thing it would be if,

377
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,160
on the very day YouKnow-Who seems 
to have disappeared at last,

378
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,200
the Muggles found out about us all.

379
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,800
I suppose he really has gone,

380
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,960
Dumbledore?"

381
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,240
"It certainly seems so,"

382
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,520
said Dumbledore.

383
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,200
"We have much to be thankful for. 
Would you care for a lemon drop?"

384
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,040
"A what?"

385
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,920
"A lemon drop. They're a kind of 
Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of"

386
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,200
"No, thank you,"

387
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,280
said Professor McGonagall coldly,

388
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,240
as though she didn't think this 
was the moment for lemon drops.

389
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,360
"As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone -"

390
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,480
"My dear Professor,

391
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,160
surely a sensible person like 
yourself can call him by his name?

392
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,360
All this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense ,

393
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,400
for eleven years I have been trying 
to persuade people to call him

394
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,680
by his proper name: Voldemort."

395
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,480
Professor McGonagall flinched,

396
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,520
but Dumbledore,

397
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
who was unsticking two lemon drops,

398
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,080
seemed not to notice.

399
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,240
"It all gets so confusing

400
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,480
if we keep saying 'You-Know-Who.'

401
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,280
I have never seen any reason to be 
frightened of saying Voldemort's name.

402
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,400
"I know you haven 't,

403
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,920
said Professor McGonagall,

404
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,600
sounding half exasperated,

405
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,240
half admiring.

406
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:11,680
"

407
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,800
But you're different.

408
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,440
Everyone knows you're the only one You-Know- oh,

409
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,960
all right, Voldemort,

410
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,160
was frightened of."

411
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,080
"You flatter me,"

412
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,640
said Dumbledore calmly.

413
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,160
"Voldemort had powers I will never have."

414
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,000
"Only because you're too , 
well , noble to use them."

415
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
"It's lucky it's dark.

416
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,200
I haven't blushed so much since Madam 
Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs."

417
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,400
Professor McGonagall shot a sharp 
look at Dumbledore and said,

418
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,920
"The owls are nothing next to the 
rumors that are flying around.

419
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,360
You know what everyone's saying?

420
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,960
About why he's disappeared?

421
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,640
About what finally stopped him?"

422
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,440
It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached 
the point she was most anxious to discuss,

423
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,760
the real reason she had been waiting on a cold,

424
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,920
hard wall all day,

425
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,960
for neither as a cat nor as a 
woman had she fixed Dumbledore

426
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,360
with such a piercing stare as she did now.

427
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,520
It was plain that whatever

428
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,200
"everyone"

429
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,040
was saying,

430
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,680
she was not going to believe it until 
Dumbledore told her it was true.

431
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,600
Dumbledore,

432
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,120
however, was choosing another 
lemon drop and did not answer.

433
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,920
"What they're saying,"

434
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
she pressed on,

435
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,160
"is that last night Voldemort 
turned up in Godric's Hollow.

436
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,880
He went to find the Potters.

437
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,560
The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are ,

438
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,080
are , that they're , dead.

439
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,360
"

440
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,560
Dumbledore bowed his head. 
Professor McGonagall gasped.

441
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,000
"Lily and James...

442
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,240
I can't believe it...

443
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,800
I didn't want to believe it...

444
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh, Albus..."

445
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,040
Dumbledore reached out and 
patted her on the shoulder.

446
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,160
"I know... I know..."

447
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,400
he said heavily.

448
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,480
Professor McGonagall's voice 
trembled as she went on.

449
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,520
"That's not all.

450
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,560
They're saying he tried to 
kill the Potter's son, Harry.

451
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,600
But , he couldn't.

452
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,400
He couldn't kill that little boy.

453
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,440
No one knows why,

454
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,680
or how, but they're saying that 
when he couldn't kill Harry Potter,

455
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,760
Voldemort's power somehow broke ,

456
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,160
and that's why he's gone.

457
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,080
Dumbledore nodded glumly.

458
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
"It's , it's true?"

459
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
faltered Professor McGonagall.

460
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,120
"After all he's done...

461
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,520
all the people he's killed...

462
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,200
he couldn't kill a little boy?

463
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,480
It's just astounding...

464
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
of all the things to stop him...

465
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,600
but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?"

466
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,960
"We can only guess,"

467
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,280
said Dumbledore.

468
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,560
"We may never know."

469
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,240
Professor McGonagall pulled 
out a lace handkerchief

470
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,880
and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles.

471
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,560
Dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a 
golden watch from his pocket and examined it.

472
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,320
It was a very odd watch.

473
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,520
It had twelve hands but no numbers;

474
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,640
instead, little planets 
were moving around the edge.

475
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,800
It must have made sense to Dumbledore,

476
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,560
though, because he put it 
back in his pocket and said,

477
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,760
"Hagrid's late.

478
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,160
I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here,

479
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,800
by the way?"

480
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,280
"Yes,"

481
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,120
said Professor McGonagall.

482
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,040
"And I don't suppose you're 
going to tell me why you're here,

483
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,320
of all places?"

484
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,720
"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle.

485
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,440
They're the only family he has left now."

486
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
"You don't mean , you can't 
mean the people who live here?"

487
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,520
cried Professor McGonagall,

488
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,280
jumping to her feet and pointing at number four.

489
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,120
"Dumbledore , you can't.

490
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,640
I've been watching them all day.

491
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,200
You couldn't find two people who are less like us.

492
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,520
And they've got this son ,

493
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,120
I saw him kicking his mother 
all the way up the street,

494
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,720
screaming for sweets.

495
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,680
Harry Potter come and live here!"

496
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,160
"It's the best place for him,"

497
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,840
said Dumbledore firmly.

498
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,880
"His aunt and uncle will be able to 
explain everything to him when he's older.

499
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,240
I've written them a letter."

500
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,960
"A letter?"

501
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,040
repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, 
sitting back down on the wall.

502
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,560
"Really, Dumbledore,

503
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,880
you think you can explain all this in a letter?

504
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,840
These people will never understand him!

505
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,800
He'll be famous ,

506
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,840
a legend , I wouldn't be surprised if today 
was known as Harry Potter day in the future ,

507
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
there will be books written about Harry ,

508
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,240
every child in our world will know his name!"

509
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,160
"Exactly,"

510
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,280
said Dumbledore,

511
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,920
looking very seriously over the 
top of his half-moon glasses.

512
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,200
"It would be enough to turn any boy's head.

513
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,400
Famous before he can walk and talk!

514
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,720
Famous for something he won't even remember!

515
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,240
CarA you see how much better off he'll be,

516
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,160
growing up away from all that 
until he's ready to take it?"

517
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,320
Professor McGonagall opened her mouth,

518
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,560
changed her mind,

519
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
swallowed, and then said,

520
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,640
"Yes , yes,

521
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,440
you're right, of course.

522
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,920
But how is the boy getting here,

523
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,000
Dumbledore?"

524
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,320
She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she 
thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.

525
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,680
"Hagrid's bringing him."

526
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,600
"You think it ,

527
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,560
wise , to trust Hagrid with 
something as important as this?"

528
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,480
I would trust Hagrid with 
my life," said Dumbledore.

529
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,960
"I'm not saying his heart 
isn't in the right place,"

530
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,160
said Professor McGonagall grudgingly,

531
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,480
"but you can't pretend he's not careless.

532
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,240
He does tend to ,

533
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,120
what was that?"

534
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,200
A low rumbling sound had 
broken the silence around them.

535
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,080
It grew steadily louder as they looked up

536
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,440
and down the street for some sign of a headlight;

537
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:43,120
it swelled to a roar as they 
both looked up at the sky ,

538
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,680
and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air 
and landed on the road in front of them.

539
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,280
If the motorcycle was huge,

540
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,640
it was nothing to the man sitting astride it.

541
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,320
He was almost twice as tall as a normal 
man and at least five times as wide.

542
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,400
He looked simply too big to be allowed,

543
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,120
and so wild - long tangles of bushy black 
hair and beard hid most of his face,

544
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,400
he had hands the size of trash can lids,

545
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,320
and his feet in their leather 
boots were like baby dolphins.

546
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,240
In his vast,

547
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,240
muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets.

548
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,880
"Hagrid,"

549
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,440
said Dumbledore, sounding relieved.

550
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,400
"At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?"

551
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,160
"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit,"

552
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,200
said the giant, climbing carefully 
off the motorcycle as he spoke.

553
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,680
"Young Sirius Black lent it 
to me. I've got him, sir."

554
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,440
"No problems, were there?"

555
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,400
"No, sir , house was almost destroyed,

556
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,360
but I got him out all right before 
the Muggles started swarmin' around.

557
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,040
He fell asleep as we was flyin' over Bristol."

558
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:44,840
Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent 
forward over the bundle of blankets.

559
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,440
Inside, just visible,

560
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,760
was a baby boy,

561
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,920
fast asleep.

562
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,800
Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his 
forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut,

563
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,280
like a bolt of lightning.

564
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,160
"Is that where -?"

565
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,240
whispered Professor McGonagall.

566
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:58,760
"Yes,"

567
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,040
said Dumbledore.

568
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,760
"He'll have that scar forever."

569
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,320
"Couldn't you do something about it, Dumbledore?"

570
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,440
"Even if I could,

571
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,280
I wouldn't.

572
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,000
Scars can come in handy.

573
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,680
I have one myself above my left knee that 
is a perfect map of the London Underground.

574
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,040
Well , give him here,

575
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,480
Hagrid , we'd better get this over with."

576
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,320
Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and 
turned toward the Dursleys' house.

577
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,560
"Could I , could I say good-bye to him, sir?"

578
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,560
asked Hagrid.

579
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,760
He bent his great,

580
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,600
shaggy head over Harry and gave him 
what must have been a very scratchy,

581
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,880
whiskery kiss.

582
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,800
Then, suddenly,

583
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,240
Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.

584
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,000
"Shhh!"

585
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,520
hissed Professor McGonagall,

586
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,960
"you'll wake the Muggles!"

587
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,760
"S-s-sorry,"

588
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,800
sobbed Hagrid,

589
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,080
taking out a large,

590
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,880
spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it.

591
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,560
"But I c-c-can't stand it ,

592
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,840
Lily an' James dead ,

593
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,600
an' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles -"

594
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,200
"Yes, yes, it's all very sad,

595
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,840
but get a grip on yourself,

596
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,120
Hagrid, or we'll be found,"

597
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,840
Professor McGonagall whispered,

598
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,080
patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as 
Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall

599
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,680
and walked to the front door.

600
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,720
He laid Harry gently on the doorstep,

601
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,240
took a letter out of his cloak,

602
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,320
tucked it inside Harry's blankets,

603
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,200
and then came back to the other two.

604
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,600
For a full minute the three of them 
stood and looked at the little bundle;

605
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,120
Hagrid's shoulders shook,

606
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,440
Professor McGonagall blinked furiously,

607
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:23,000
and the twinkling light that usually shone 
from Dumbledore's eyes seemed to have gone out.

608
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,400
"Well,"

609
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,960
said Dumbledore finally,

610
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,800
"that's that.

611
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,560
We've no business staying here.

612
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,680
We may as well go and join the celebrations."

613
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,000
"Yeah,"

614
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
said Hagrid in a very muffled voice,

615
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,440
"I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back.

616
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,240
G'night, Professor McGonagall ,

617
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,240
Professor Dumbledore,

618
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,080
sir."

619
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,440
Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve,

620
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,360
Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle 
and kicked the engine into life;

621
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,400
with a roar it rose into the 
air and off into the night.

622
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,920
"I shall see you soon, I 
expect, Professor McGonagall,"

623
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,000
said Dumbledore,

624
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,240
nodding to her.

625
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,880
Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.

626
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,720
Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street.

627
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,840
On the corner he stopped and 
took out the silver Put-Outer.

628
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,920
He clicked it once,

629
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,840
and twelve balls of light sped 
back to their street lamps so

630
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,200
that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange

631
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,920
and he could make out a tabby 
cat slinking around the corner

632
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,600
at the other end of the street.

633
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,960
He could just see the bundle of 
blankets on the step of number four.

634
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,200
"Good luck, Harry,"

635
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,120
he murmured.

636
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,640
He turned on his heel and 
with a swish of his cloak,

637
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,760
he was gone.

638
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,360
A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive,

639
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,120
which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky,

640
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,320
the very last place you would 
expect astonishing things to happen.

641
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,920
Harry Potter rolled over inside 
his blankets without waking up.

642
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,520
One small hand closed on the 
letter beside him and he slept on,

643
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,000
not knowing he was special,

644
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,600
not knowing he was famous,

645
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,760
not knowing he would be woken

646
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,480
in a few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's 
scream as she opened the front door

647
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,240
to put out the milk bottles,

648
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,520
nor that he would spend the 
next few weeks being prodded

649
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,400
and pinched by his cousin Dudley...

650
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,480
He couldn't know that at this very moment,

651
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,080
people meeting in secret all over the 
country were holding up their glasses

652
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,880
and saying in hushed voices:

653
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,960
"To Harry Potter , the boy who lived!"

654
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,000
CHAPTER TWO

655
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,560
THE VANISHING GLASS

656
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,600
Nearly ten years had passed since the 
Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew

657
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,760
on the front step,

658
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,520
but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.

659
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,760
The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens

660
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,800
and lit up the brass number four 
on the Dursleys' front door;

661
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,680
it crept into their living room,

662
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,360
which was almost exactly the 
same as it had been on the night

663
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,080
when Mr. Dursley had seen that 
fateful news report about the owls.

664
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,240
Only the photographs on the mantelpiece 
really showed how much time had passed.

665
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,280
Ten years ago,

666
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,720
there had been lots of pictures of

667
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,200
what looked like a large pink beach 
ball wearing different-colored bonnets ,

668
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,920
but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby,

669
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,000
and now the photographs showed a large 
blond boy riding his first bicycle,

670
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,880
on a carousel at the fair,

671
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,000
playing a computer game with his father,

672
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,320
being hugged and kissed by his mother.

673
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:55,080
The room held no sign at all that 
another boy lived in the house, too.

674
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,120
Yet Harry Potter was still there,

675
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,480
asleep at the moment,

676
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,680
but not for long.

677
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,120
His Aunt Petunia was awake

678
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,600
and it was her shrill voice that 
made the first noise of the day.

679
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,680
"Up! Get up! Now!"

680
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,120
Harry woke with a start. His 
aunt rapped on the door again.

681
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:10,560
"Up!"

682
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,640
she screeched.

683
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen

684
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,560
and then the sound of the frying 
pan being put on the stove.

685
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,520
He rolled onto his back and tried to 
remember the dream he had been having.

686
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,840
It had been a good one.

687
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,080
There had been a flying motorcycle in it.

688
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,120
He had a funny feeling he'd 
had the same dream before.

689
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,120
His aunt was back outside the door.

690
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,160
"Are you up yet?"

691
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,320
she demanded.

692
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,880
"Nearly,"

693
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,000
said Harry.

694
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,640
"Well, get a move on,

695
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
I want you to look after the bacon.

696
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,000
And don't you dare let it burn,

697
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,600
I want everything perfect on Duddy's birthday."

698
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,640
Harry groaned.

699
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,680
"What did you say?"

700
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,520
his aunt snapped through the door.

701
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,360
"Nothing, nothing..."

702
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,440
Dudley's birthday ,

703
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,880
how could he have forgotten?

704
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,160
Harry got slowly out of bed 
and started looking for socks.

705
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,960
He found a pair under his bed and,

706
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,440
after pulling a spider off one of them,

707
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
put them on.

708
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,120
Harry was used to spiders,

709
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,560
because the cupboard under 
the stairs was full of them,

710
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,080
and that was where he slept.

711
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,840
When he was dressed he went 
down the hall into the kitchen.

712
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,720
The table was almost hidden beneath 
all Dudley's birthday presents.

713
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,720
It looked as though Dudley had 
gotten the new computer he wanted,

714
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,040
not to mention the second 
television and the racing bike.

715
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:19,560
Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing 
bike was a mystery to Harry,

716
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:22,480
as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise ,

717
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,960
unless of course it involved punching somebody.

718
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,160
Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry,

719
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,920
but he couldn't often catch him.

720
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,080
Harry didn't look it,

721
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,800
but he was very fast.

722
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,640
Perhaps it had something to do 
with living in a dark cupboard,

723
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,920
but Harry had always been 
small and skinny for his age.

724
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,600
He looked even smaller and 
skinnier than he really was

725
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,480
because all he had to wear 
were old clothes of Dudley's,

726
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,480
and Dudley was about four 
times bigger than he was.

727
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,960
Harry had a thin face,

728
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,080
knobbly knees,

729
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:49,920
black hair,

730
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,400
and bright green eyes.

731
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,600
He wore round glasses held 
together with a lot of Scotch tape

732
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,600
because of all the times Dudley 
had punched him on the nose.

733
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,040
The only thing Harry liked about his 
own appearance was a very thin scar

734
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,400
on his forehead that was shaped

735
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,800
like a bolt of lightning.

736
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,880
He had had it as long as he could remember,

737
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,360
and the first question he could ever 
remember asking his Aunt Petunia was

738
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,560
how he had gotten it.

739
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,640
"In the car crash when your parents died,"

740
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,720
she had said.

741
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,360
"And don't ask questions."

742
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,640
Don't ask questions ,

743
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,960
that was the first rule for a 
quiet life with the Dursleys.

744
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,600
Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as 
Harry was turning over the bacon.

745
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,640
"Comb your hair!"

746
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,360
he barked, by way of a morning greeting.

747
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,440
About once a week,

748
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:33,200
Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper 
and shouted that Harry needed a haircut.

749
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,800
Harry must have had more haircuts than 
the rest of the boys in his class put

750
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,680
together, but it made no difference,

751
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,240
his hair simply grew that way ,

752
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,640
all over the place.

753
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,680
Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley 
arrived in the kitchen with his mother.

754
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,880
Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon.

755
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,400
He had a large pink face,

756
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,480
not much neck,

757
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,440
small, watery blue eyes,

758
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,120
and thick blond hair that lay 
smoothly on his thick, fat head.

759
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:59,400
Aunt Petunia often said that 
Dudley looked like a baby angel ,

760
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,520
Harry often said that Dudley 
looked like a pig in a wig.

761
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,200
Harry put the plates of 
egg and bacon on the table,

762
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,320
which was difficult as there wasn't much room.

763
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,680
Dudley, meanwhile,

764
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,400
was counting his presents.

765
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,480
His face fell.

766
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,280
"Thirty-six,"

767
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,240
he said, looking up at his mother and father.

768
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,960
"That's two less than last year."

769
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,840
"Darling, you haven't counted 
Auntie Marge's present,

770
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,040
see, it's here under this big 
one from Mommy and Daddy."

771
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,880
"All right, thirty-seven then,"

772
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,760
said Dudley,

773
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,440
going red in the face.

774
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,720
Harry, who could see a huge 
Dudley tantrum coming on,

775
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,800
began wolfing down his bacon as fast as 
possible in case Dudley turned the table over.

776
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,040
Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger,

777
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,920
too, because she said quickly,

778
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,880
"And we'll buy you another two 
presents while we're out today.

779
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,480
How's that, popkin?

780
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,880
Two more presents.

781
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,440
Is that all right''

782
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,040
Dudley thought for a moment.

783
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,600
It looked like hard work.

784
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,080
Finally he said slowly,

785
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,400
"So I'll have thirty ... thirty..."

786
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,120
"Thirty-nine, sweetums,"

787
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,520
said Aunt Petunia.

788
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,160
"Oh."

789
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,320
Dudley sat down heavily and 
grabbed the nearest parcel.

790
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,280
"All right then."

791
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,760
Uncle Vernon chuckled.

792
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,520
"Little tyke wants his money's worth,

793
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,800
just like his father.

794
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
'Atta boy, Dudley!"

795
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,520
He ruffled Dudley's hair.

796
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,040
At that moment the telephone rang

797
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,520
and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry

798
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,520
and Uncle Vernon watched 
Dudley unwrap the racing bike,

799
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,680
a video camera,

800
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,440
a remote control airplane,

801
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,520
sixteen new computer games, and a VCR.

802
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,600
He was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch

803
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,000
when Aunt Petunia came back from the 
telephone looking both angry and worried.

804
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,960
"Bad news, Vernon," she said.

805
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,040
"Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him."

806
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,280
She jerked her head in Harry's direction.

807
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,440
Dudley's mouth fell open in horror,

808
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,280
but Harry's heart gave a leap.

809
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,960
Every year on Dudley's birthday,

810
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,480
his parents took him and a friend out for the day,

811
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,880
to adventure parks,

812
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
hamburger restaurants,

813
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
or the movies.

814
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,280
Every year,

815
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,560
Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg,

816
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,200
a mad old lady who lived two streets away.

817
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,640
Harry hated it there.

818
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,200
The whole house smelled of cabbage

819
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,440
and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs 
of all the cats she'd ever owned.

820
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,120
"Now what?"

821
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,320
said Aunt Petunia,

822
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,200
looking furiously at Harry 
as though he'd planned this.

823
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,760
Harry knew he ought to feel sorry 
that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg,

824
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:13,680
but it wasn't easy when he reminded 
himself it would be a whole year

825
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,520
before he had to look at Tibbles,

826
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,240
Snowy, Mr. Paws,

827
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,560
and Tufty again.

828
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,600
"We could phone Marge,"

829
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,280
Uncle Vernon suggested.

830
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,400
"Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy."

831
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,000
The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this,

832
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,360
as though he wasn't there ,

833
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,320
or rather, as though he was something 
very nasty that couldn't understand them,

834
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,440
like a slug.

835
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,320
"What about what's-her-name, 
your friend , Yvonne?"

836
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,880
"On vacation in Majorca,"

837
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,440
snapped Aunt Petunia.

838
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,880
"You could just leave me here,"

839
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,600
Harry put in hopefully (he'd be able to watch

840
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,320
what he wanted on television for a change and 
maybe even have a go on Dudley's computer).

841
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,120
Aunt Petunia looked as though 
she'd just swallowed a lemon.

842
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,320
"And come back and find the house in ruins?"

843
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,400
she snarled.

844
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,640
"I won't blow up the house,"

845
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,000
said Harry, but they weren't listening.

846
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,800
"I suppose we could take him to the zoo,"

847
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,120
said Aunt Petunia slowly,

848
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,400
"... and leave him in the car...."

849
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,360
"That car's new, he's not sitting in it alone...."

850
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,280
Dudley began to cry loudly.

851
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,000
In fact, he wasn't really crying ,

852
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,920
it had been years since he'd really cried ,

853
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,640
but he knew that if he screwed 
up his face and wailed,

854
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,960
his mother would give him anything he wanted.

855
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,520
"Dinky Duddydums,

856
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,400
don't cry, Mummy won't let 
him spoil your special day!"

857
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,280
she cried, flinging her arms around him.

858
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,440
"I... don't... want... him... t-t-to come!"

859
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,400
Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs.

860
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,600
"He always sp- spoils everything!"

861
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,200
He shot Harry a nasty grin through 
the gap in his mother's arms.

862
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,120
Just then, the doorbell rang ,

863
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,000
"Oh, good Lord, they're here!"

864
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,720
said Aunt Petunia frantically ,

865
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,960
and a moment later,

866
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,280
Dudley's best friend,

867
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,480
Piers Polkiss,

868
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,920
walked in with his mother.

869
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,720
Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat.

870
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,080
He was usually the one who held people's arms 
behind their backs while Dudley hit them.

871
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,360
Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.

872
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,600
Half an hour later,

873
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,560
Harry, who couldn't believe his luck,

874
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,920
was sitting in the back of the 
Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley,

875
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,640
on the way to the zoo for 
the first time in his life.

876
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,560
His aunt and uncle hadn't been able to 
think of anything else to do with him,

877
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,960
but before they'd left,

878
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,360
Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.

879
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,120
"I'm warning you,"

880
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,040
he had said, putting his large purple 
face right up close to Harry's,

881
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,200
"I'm warning you now,

882
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,040
boy , any funny business,

883
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,000
anything at all ,

884
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,680
and you'll be in that cupboard 
from now until Christmas."

885
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,120
"I'm not going to do anything,"

886
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,000
said Harry, "honestly..

887
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:32,440
But Uncle Vernon didn't 
believe him. No one ever did.

888
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,480
The problem was,

889
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,880
strange things often happened around Harry

890
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,960
and it was just no good telling the 
Dursleys he didn't make them happen.

891
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,360
Once, Aunt Petunia,

892
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,600
tired of Harry coming back from the barbers 
looking as though he hadn't been at all,

893
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,360
had taken a pair of kitchen scissors

894
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,960
and cut his hair so short he was 
almost bald except for his bangs,

895
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,560
which she left

896
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,520
"to hide that horrible scar."

897
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,840
Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry,

898
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,120
who spent a sleepless night 
imagining school the next day,

899
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,600
where he was already laughed at for 
his baggy clothes and taped glasses.

900
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,440
Next morning,

901
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,480
however, he had gotten up to find 
his hair exactly as it had been

902
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,960
before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had 
been given a week in his cupboard for this,

903
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,400
even though he had tried to 
explain that he couldn't explain

904
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,520
how it had grown back so quickly.

905
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,480
Another time,

906
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:22,000
Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into 
a revolting old sweater of Dudley's (brown

907
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,680
with orange puff balls) ,

908
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,120
The harder she tried to pull it over his head,

909
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,880
the smaller it seemed to become,

910
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,520
until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet,

911
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,440
but certainly wouldn't fit Harry.

912
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,880
Aunt Petunia had decided it must 
have shrunk in the wash and,

913
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,240
to his great relief,

914
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,800
Harry wasn't punished.

915
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,720
On the other hand,

916
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,840
he'd gotten into terrible trouble for being 
found on the roof of the school kitchens.

917
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,640
Dudley's gang had been chasing him as usual when,

918
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,200
as much to Harry's surprise as anyone else's,

919
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,920
there he was sitting on the chimney.

920
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,280
The Dursleys had received a very angry letter

921
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,200
from Harry's headmistress telling them 
Harry had been climbing school buildings.

922
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,240
But all he'd tried to do (as he shouted

923
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,840
at Uncle Vernon through the locked door

924
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:05,440
of his cupboard) was jump behind the big 
trash cans outside the kitchen doors.

925
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,440
Harry supposed that the wind must 
have caught him in mid- jump.

926
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,920
But today, nothing was going to go wrong.

927
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,480
It was even worth being with Dudley

928
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,360
and Piers to be spending the day 
somewhere that wasn't school,

929
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,120
his cupboard,

930
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,760
or Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living room.

931
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
While he drove,

932
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,160
Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia.

933
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,240
He liked to complain about things: people at work,

934
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,920
Harry, the council,

935
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,360
Harry, the bank,

936
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,480
and Harry were just a few 
of his favorite subjects.

937
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,000
This morning,

938
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,880
it was motorcycles.

939
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,360
"... roaring along like 
maniacs, the young hoodlums,"

940
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,960
he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.

941
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,420
I had a dream about a motorcycle,

942
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,120
" said Harry, remembering suddenly. "

943
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,200
It was flying."

944
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,120
Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front.

945
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,840
He turned right around in 
his seat and yelled at Harry,

946
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,560
his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache:

947
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,360
"MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!"

948
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,120
Dudley and Piers sniggered.

949
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,760
I know they don't,

950
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,000
" said Harry. "

951
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,400
It was only a dream."

952
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,440
But he wished he hadn't said anything.

953
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,160
If there was one thing the Dursleys hated 
even more than his asking questions,

954
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,360
it was his talking about anything 
acting in a way it shouldn't,

955
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,240
no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon ,

956
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,040
they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.

957
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,960
It was a very sunny Saturday and 
the zoo was crowded with families.

958
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,640
The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large 
chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then,

959
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,200
because the smiling lady 
in the van had asked Harry

960
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,080
what he wanted before they could hurry him away,

961
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,160
they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop.

962
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,320
It wasn't bad,

963
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,800
either, Harry thought,

964
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,160
licking it as they watched a 
gorilla scratching its head

965
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,200
who looked remarkably like Dudley,

966
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,920
except that it wasn't blond.

967
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,600
Harry had the best morning 
he'd had in a long time.

968
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,960
He was careful to walk a little way apart 
from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers,

969
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,960
who were starting to get bored 
with the animals by lunchtime,

970
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,880
wouldn't fall back on their 
favorite hobby of hitting him.

971
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,440
They ate in the zoo restaurant,

972
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,840
and when Dudley had a tantrum

973
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,440
because his knickerbocker glory 
didn't have enough ice cream on top,

974
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,640
Uncle Vernon bought him another one and 
Harry was allowed to finish the first.

975
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,560
Harry felt,

976
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,960
afterward, that he should have 
known it was all too good to last.

977
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,200
After lunch they went to the reptile house.

978
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,840
It was cool and dark in there,

979
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,040
with lit windows all along the walls.

980
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,120
Behind the glass,

981
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:18,480
all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling 
and slithering over bits of wood and stone.

982
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,560
Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge,

983
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,360
poisonous cobras and thick,

984
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,160
man-crushing pythons.

985
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,120
Dudley quickly found the 
largest snake in the place.

986
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:30,280
It could have wrapped its body 
twice around Uncle Vernon's car

987
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,400
and crushed it into a trash can ,

988
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,600
but at the moment it didn't look in the mood.

989
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,640
In fact, it was fast asleep.

990
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,160
Dudley stood with his nose 
pressed against the glass,

991
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,480
staring at the glistening brown coils.

992
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,320
"Make it move,"

993
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
he whined at his father.

994
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,760
Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass,

995
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,320
but the snake didn't budge.

996
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,280
"Do it again,"

997
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,360
Dudley ordered.

998
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,360
Uncle Vernon rapped the glass 
smartly with his knuckles,

999
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,320
but the snake just snoozed on.

1000
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,280
"This is boring,"

1001
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,640
Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.

1002
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,160
Harry moved in front of the tank 
and looked intently at the snake.

1003
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,600
He wouldn't have been surprised 
if it had died of boredom itself ,

1004
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,240
no company except stupid 
people drumming their fingers

1005
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,080
on the glass trying to disturb it all day long.

1006
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,600
It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom,

1007
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,520
where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia 
hammering on the door to wake you up;

1008
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,120
at least he got to visit the rest of the house.

1009
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,840
The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes.

1010
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,320
Slowly, very slowly,

1011
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,560
it raised its head until its eyes were 
on a level with Harry's. It winked.

1012
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,600
Harry stared.

1013
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,200
Then he looked quickly around 
to see if anyone was watching.

1014
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,160
They weren't.

1015
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,760
He looked back at the snake and winked, too.

1016
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,760
The snake jerked its head 
toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley,

1017
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,320
then raised its eyes to the ceiling.

1018
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:44,160
It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:

1019
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,680
"I get that all the time.

1020
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,240
"I know,"

1021
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,880
Harry murmured through the glass,

1022
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,400
though he wasn't sure the snake could hear him.

1023
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,040
"It must be really annoying."

1024
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,840
The snake nodded vigorously.

1025
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,800
"Where do you come from, anyway?"

1026
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,920
Harry asked.

1027
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,320
The snake jabbed its tail at a 
little sign next to the glass.

1028
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,160
Harry peered at it.

1029
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
Boa Constrictor, Brazil.

1030
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,280
"Was it nice there?"

1031
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,960
The boa constrictor jabbed 
its tail at the sign again

1032
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,840
and Harry read on: This 
specimen was bred in the zoo.

1033
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,000
"Oh, I see , so you've never been to Brazil?"

1034
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,480
As the snake shook its head,

1035
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,520
a deafening shout behind Harry 
made both of them jump. "DUDLEY!

1036
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,120
MR. DURSLEY!

1037
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,600
COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE!

1038
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,240
YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!"

1039
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,440
Dudley came waddling toward 
them as fast as he could.

1040
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,320
"Out of the way, you,"

1041
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,800
he said, punching Harry in the ribs.

1042
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,960
Caught by surprise,

1043
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,320
Harry fell hard on the concrete floor.

1044
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,760
What came next happened so fast 
no one saw how it happened ,

1045
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,640
one second,

1046
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,080
Piers and Dudley were leaning 
right up close to the glass,

1047
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,760
the next, they had leapt 
back with howls of horror.

1048
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,320
Harry sat up and gasped;

1049
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,560
the glass front of the boa 
constrictor's tank had vanished.

1050
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,120
The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly,

1051
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,960
slithering out onto the floor.

1052
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,640
People throughout the reptile house 
screamed and started running for the exits.

1053
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,800
As the snake slid swiftly past him,

1054
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,280
Harry could have sworn a low,

1055
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,960
hissing voice said,

1056
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720
"Brazil, here I come.... Thanksss, amigo."

1057
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,200
The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.

1058
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,120
"But the glass,"

1059
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,080
he kept saying,

1060
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,480
"where did the glass go?"

1061
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,880
The zoo director himself made 
Aunt Petunia a cup of strong,

1062
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,400
sweet tea while he apologized over and over again.

1063
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,520
Piers and Dudley could only gibber.

1064
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
As far as Harry had seen,

1065
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,280
the snake hadn't done anything except snap 
playfully at their heels as it passed,

1066
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,320
but by the time they were all 
back in Uncle Vernon's car,

1067
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,600
Dudley was telling them how it 
had nearly bitten off his leg,

1068
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,560
while Piers was swearing it had 
tried to squeeze him to death.

1069
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,480
But worst of all,

1070
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,720
for Harry at least,

1071
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,880
was Piers calming down enough to say,

1072
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,840
"Harry was talking to it, weren't you, Harry?"

1073
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,680
Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely 
out of the house before starting on Harry.

1074
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,160
He was so angry he could hardly speak.

1075
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,400
He managed to say,

1076
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,880
"Go , cupboard , stay , no meals,"

1077
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,960
before he collapsed into a chair,

1078
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,800
and Aunt Petunia had to run 
and get him a large brandy.

1079
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,000
Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later,

1080
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,640
wishing he had a watch.

1081
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,920
He didn't know what time it was and he 
couldn't be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet.

1082
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,880
Until they were,

1083
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,640
he couldn't risk sneaking to 
the kitchen for some food.

1084
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,040
He'd lived with the Dursleys almost ten years,

1085
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,440
ten miserable years,

1086
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,040
as long as he could remember,

1087
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,040
ever since he'd been a baby and his 
parents had died in that car crash.

1088
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,640
He couldn't remember being in the 
car when his parents had died.

1089
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,160
Sometimes, when he strained his memory 
during long hours in his cupboard,

1090
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,560
he came up with a strange vision: 
a blinding flash of green light

1091
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,800
and a burn- ing pain on his forehead.

1092
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,880
This, he supposed,

1093
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,920
was the crash,

1094
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,960
though he couldn't imagine where 
all the green light came from.

1095
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,160
He couldn't remember his parents at all.

1096
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,240
His aunt and uncle never spoke about them,

1097
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,840
and of course he was forbidden to ask questions.

1098
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,360
There were no photographs of them in the house.

1099
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,600
When he had been younger,

1100
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:56,680
Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some 
unknown relation coming to take him away,

1101
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,120
but it had never happened;

1102
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,240
the Dursleys were his only family.

1103
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,040
Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that 
strangers in the street seemed to know him.

1104
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,480
Very strange strangers they were, too.

1105
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,840
A tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to 
him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia

1106
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,880
and Dudley.

1107
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,840
After asking Harry furiously if he knew the man,

1108
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,320
Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of 
the shop without buying anything.

1109
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,560
A wild-looking old woman dressed all in 
green had waved merrily at him once on a bus.

1110
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,400
A bald man in a very long purple 
coat had actually shaken his hand

1111
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,720
in the street the other day

1112
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,720
and then walked away without a word.

1113
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,000
The weirdest thing about 
all these people was the way

1114
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,520
they seemed to vanish the second 
Harry tried to get a closer look.

1115
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,640
At school, Harry had no one.

1116
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,120
Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that 
odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes

1117
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,560
and broken glasses,

1118
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,440
and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley's gang.

1119
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,160
CHAPTER THREE

1120
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,800
THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE

1121
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,640
The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor 
earned Harry his longest-ever punishment.

1122
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,960
By the time he was allowed 
out of his cupboard again,

1123
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,600
the summer holidays had started and Dudley 
had already broken his new video camera,

1124
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,920
crashed his remote control airplane,

1125
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,640
and, first time out on his racing bike,

1126
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,680
knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she 
crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.

1127
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,520
Harry was glad school was over,

1128
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,720
but there was no escaping Dudley's gang,

1129
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,960
who visited the house every single day.

1130
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,320
Piers, Dennis,

1131
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,120
Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid,

1132
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:25,120
but as Dudley was the biggest 
and stupidest of the lot,

1133
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,320
he was the leader.

1134
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:31,120
The rest of them were all quite happy to join 
in Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.

1135
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,680
This was why Harry spent as much 
time as possible out of the house,

1136
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,600
wandering around and thinking 
about the end of the holidays,

1137
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,760
where he could see a tiny ray of hope.

1138
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,200
When September came he would be 
going off to secondary school and,

1139
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,840
for the first time in his life,

1140
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,280
he wouldn't be with Dudley.

1141
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,520
Dudley had been accepted at Uncle 
Vernon's old private school, Smeltings.

1142
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,520
Piers Polkiss was going there too.

1143
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,000
Harry, on the other hand,

1144
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,680
was going to Stonewall High,

1145
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,200
the local public school.

1146
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
Dudley thought this was very funny.

1147
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,640
"They stuff people's heads down the 
toilet the first day at Stonewall,"

1148
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,840
he told Harry.

1149
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,960
"Want to come upstairs and practice?"

1150
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,960
"No, thanks,"

1151
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:07,880
said Harry.

1152
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,560
"The poor toilet's never had anything 
as horrible as your head down it ,

1153
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,920
it might be sick."

1154
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,240
Then he ran, before Dudley 
could work out what he'd said.

1155
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,400
One day in July,

1156
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,560
Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London 
to buy his Smeltings uniform,

1157
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,560
leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg's.

1158
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,800
Mrs. Figg wasn 't as bad as usual.

1159
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,280
It turned out she'd broken her 
leg tripping over one of her cats,

1160
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,120
and she didn't seem quite 
as fond of them as before.

1161
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,800
She let Harry watch television

1162
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,240
and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that 
tasted as though she'd had it for several years.

1163
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:37,960
That evening,

1164
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,840
Dudley paraded around the living room 
for the family in his brand-new uniform.

1165
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,120
Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats,

1166
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,480
orange knickerbockers,

1167
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,800
and flat straw hats called boaters.

1168
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,480
They also carried knobbly sticks,

1169
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,400
used for hitting each other while 
the teachers weren't looking.

1170
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,720
This was supposed to be good 
training for later life.

1171
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,040
As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers,

1172
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,200
Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it 
was the proudest moment of his life.

1173
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,400
Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she 
couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins,

1174
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,480
he looked so handsome and grown-up.

1175
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,640
Harry didn't trust himself to speak.

1176
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,480
He thought two of his ribs might already 
have cracked from trying not to laugh.

1177
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,920
There was a horrible smell in 
the kitchen the next morning

1178
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,880
when Harry went in for breakfast.

1179
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,880
It seemed to be coming from a 
large metal tub in the sink.

1180
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,200
He went to have a look.

1181
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,880
The tub was full of what looked like 
dirty rags swimming in gray water.

1182
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,800
"What's this?"

1183
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,280
he asked Aunt Petunia.

1184
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,640
Her lips tightened as they always 
did if he dared to ask a question.

1185
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,800
"Your new school uniform," she said.

1186
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,600
Harry looked in the bowl again.

1187
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,000
"Oh,"

1188
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
he said, "I didn't realize it had to be so wet."

1189
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,080
"DotA be stupid,"

1190
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,520
snapped Aunt Petunia.

1191
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:45,160
"I'm dyeing some of Dudley's 
old things gray for you.

1192
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,840
It'll look just like everyone 
else's when I've finished."

1193
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,680
Harry seriously doubted this,

1194
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,600
but thought it best not to argue.

1195
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,080
He sat down at the table 
and tried not to think about

1196
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,200
how he was going to look on his 
first day at Stonewall High ,

1197
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,720
like he was wearing bits of 
old elephant skin, probably.

1198
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,720
Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in,

1199
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,440
both with wrinkled noses because of 
the smell from Harry's new uniform.

1200
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,880
Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual 
and Dudley banged his Smelting stick,

1201
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,280
which he carried everywhere,

1202
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,320
on the table.

1203
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,960
They heard the click of the mail slot 
and flop of letters on the doormat.

1204
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,400
"Get the mail, Dudley,"

1205
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,800
said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.

1206
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,000
"Make Harry get it."

1207
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,720
"Get the mail, Harry."

1208
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:24,960
"Make Dudley get it."

1209
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,440
"Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley."

1210
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,400
Harry dodged the Smelting 
stick and went to get the mail.

1211
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,640
Three things lay on the doormat: a 
postcard from Uncle Vernon's sister Marge,

1212
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,840
who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight,

1213
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,960
a brown envelope that looked like a bill,

1214
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,600
and , a letter for Harry.

1215
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,480
Harry picked it up and stared at it,

1216
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,320
his heart twanging like a giant elastic band.

1217
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:46,560
No one, ever,

1218
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,640
in his whole life,

1219
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,600
had written to him. Who would?

1220
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,800
He had no friends,

1221
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,960
no other relatives ,

1222
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,720
he didn't belong to the library,

1223
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,920
so he'd never even got rude 
notes asking for books back.

1224
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,320
Yet here it was,

1225
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,320
a letter, addressed so plainly 
there could be no mistake:

1226
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,920
Mr. H. Potter

1227
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,040
The Cupboard under the Stairs

1228
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,560
4 Privet Drive

1229
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,640
Little Whinging

1230
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,560
Surrey

1231
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,480
The envelope was thick and heavy,

1232
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,040
made of yellowish parchment,

1233
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,600
and the address was written in emerald-green ink.

1234
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,880
There was no stamp.

1235
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,400
Turning the envelope over,

1236
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,600
his hand trembling,

1237
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,760
Harry saw a purple wax seal 
bearing a coat of arms;

1238
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,360
a lion, an eagle,

1239
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,920
a badger, and a snake 
surrounding a large letter H.

1240
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,240
"Hurry up, boy!"

1241
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,320
shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen.

1242
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,880
"What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?"

1243
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,600
He chuckled at his own joke.

1244
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,080
Harry went back to the kitchen,

1245
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,720
still staring at his letter.

1246
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,400
He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard,

1247
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,960
sat down, and slowly began 
to open the yellow envelope.

1248
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,840
Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill,

1249
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,160
snorted in disgust,

1250
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,840
and flipped over the postcard.

1251
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,760
"Marge's ill,"

1252
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,480
he informed Aunt Petunia.

1253
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,400
"Ate a funny whelk. , ."

1254
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,040
"Dad!"

1255
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,600
said Dudley suddenly.

1256
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,840
"Dad, Harry's got something!"

1257
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,800
Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter,

1258
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,760
which was written on the same 
heavy parchment as the envelope,

1259
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,920
when it was jerked sharply out 
of his hand by Uncle Vernon.

1260
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,800
"That's mine!"

1261
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,040
said Harry, trying to snatch it back.

1262
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,440
"Who'd be writing to you?"

1263
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,760
sneered Uncle Vernon,

1264
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,400
shaking the letter open with 
one hand and glancing at it.

1265
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,040
His face went from red to green 
faster than a set of traffic lights.

1266
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,560
And it didn't stop there.

1267
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:23,680
Within seconds it was the 
grayish white of old porridge.

1268
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,800
"P-P-Petunia!" he gasped.

1269
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,960
Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it,

1270
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,040
but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach.

1271
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,240
Aunt Petunia took it curiously 
and read the first line.

1272
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,640
For a moment it looked as though she might faint.

1273
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,400
She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.

1274
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,080
"Vernon! Oh my goodness , Vernon!"

1275
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,360
They stared at each other,

1276
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:47,280
seeming to have forgotten that Harry 
and Dudley were still in the room.

1277
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,320
Dudley wasn't used to being ignored.

1278
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,840
He gave his father a sharp tap on 
the head with his Smelting stick.

1279
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,920
"I want to read that letter,"

1280
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:55,920
he said loudly. want to read it,

1281
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,560
" said Harry furiously, "

1282
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,640
as it's mine."

1283
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,120
"Get out, both of you,"

1284
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,880
croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the 
letter back inside its envelope.

1285
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,200
Harry didn't move.

1286
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,000
I WANT MY LETTER!" he shouted.

1287
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,960
"Let me see it!"

1288
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,240
demanded Dudley.

1289
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:09,920
"OUT!"

1290
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,200
roared Uncle Vernon,

1291
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,240
and he took both Harry

1292
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,480
and Dudley by the scruffs of their 
necks and threw them into the hall,

1293
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,720
slamming the kitchen door behind them.

1294
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,080
Harry and Dudley promptly had 
a furious but silent fight over

1295
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,640
who would listen at the keyhole;

1296
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,560
Dudley won,

1297
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,320
so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear,

1298
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,320
lay flat on his stomach to listen 
at the crack between door and floor.

1299
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,120
"Vernon,"

1300
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,360
Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice,

1301
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,760
"look at the address ,

1302
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:37,040
how could they possibly know where he sleeps?

1303
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,000
You don't think they're watching the house?"

1304
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,200
"Watching , spying , might be following us,"

1305
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,080
muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.

1306
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,920
"But what should we do, Vernon?

1307
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,160
Should we write back?

1308
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,260
Tell them we don't want ,

1309
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:47,600
"

1310
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,040
Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black 
shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.

1311
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:52,440
"No,"

1312
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,760
he said finally.

1313
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,320
"No, we'll ignore it.

1314
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,720
If they don't get an answer...

1315
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,800
Yes, that's best...

1316
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,680
we won't do anything....

1317
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:01,560
"But , "

1318
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,800
"I'm not having one in the house, Petunia!

1319
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:08,240
Didn't we swear when we took him in 
we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?"

1320
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,120
That evening when he got back from work,

1321
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,960
Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before;

1322
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,960
he visited Harry in his cupboard.

1323
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,000
"Where's my letter?"

1324
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,640
said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon 
had squeezed through the door.

1325
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,920
"Who's writing to me?"

1326
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,560
"No one. it was addressed to you by mistake,"

1327
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,240
said Uncle Vernon shortly.

1328
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,240
"I have burned it."

1329
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,560
"It was not a mistake,"

1330
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,760
said Harry angrily,

1331
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,320
"it had my cupboard on it."

1332
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,160
"SILENCE!"

1333
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,400
yelled Uncle Vernon,

1334
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,920
and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling.

1335
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,600
He took a few deep breaths and 
then forced his face into a smile,

1336
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,680
which looked quite painful.

1337
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,520
"Er , yes, Harry , about this cupboard.

1338
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,880
Your aunt and I have been thinking...

1339
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,880
you're really getting a bit big for it...

1340
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,920
we think it might be nice if you 
moved into Dudley's second bedroom.

1341
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:52,200
"Why?"

1342
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,200
said Harry.

1343
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,400
"Don't ask questions!"

1344
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,640
snapped his uncle.

1345
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,800
"Take this stuff upstairs, now."

1346
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,320
The Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: 
one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia,

1347
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:05,200
one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister,

1348
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,320
Marge), one where Dudley slept,

1349
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,120
and one where Dudley kept all the toys

1350
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,920
and things that wouldn't 
fit into his first bedroom.

1351
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,200
It only took Harry one trip 
upstairs to move everything he owned

1352
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,720
from the cupboard to this room.

1353
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,120
He sat down on the bed and stared around him.

1354
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,160
Nearly everything in here was broken.

1355
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,320
The month-old video camera 
was lying on top of a small,

1356
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,000
working tank Dudley had once driven 
over the next door neighbor's dog;

1357
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,120
in the corner was Dudley's 
first-ever television set,

1358
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,920
which he'd put his foot through when 
his favorite program had been canceled;

1359
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,520
there was a large birdcage,

1360
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,760
which had once held a parrot that Dudley 
had swapped at school for a real air rifle,

1361
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,640
which was up on a shelf with the end 
all bent because Dudley had sat on it.

1362
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,600
Other shelves were full of books.

1363
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,920
They were the only things in the room that 
looked as though they'd never been touched.

1364
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,320
From downstairs came the sound 
of Dudley bawling at his mother,

1365
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:55,960
I don't want him in there...

1366
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:57,000
I need that room...

1367
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,560
make him get out...."

1368
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,960
Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed.

1369
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,520
Yesterday he'd have given anything to be up here.

1370
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,840
Today he'd rather be back in his cupboard 
with that letter than up here without it.

1371
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,160
Next morning at breakfast,

1372
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,720
everyone was rather quiet.

1373
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,200
Dudley was in shock.

1374
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,120
He'd screamed,

1375
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,240
whacked his father with his Smelting stick,

1376
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,600
been sick on purpose,

1377
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,600
kicked his mother,

1378
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,120
and thrown his tortoise 
through the greenhouse roof,

1379
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,160
and he still didn't have his room back.

1380
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,280
Harry was thinking about this time yesterday

1381
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,920
and bitterly wishing he'd 
opened the letter in the hall.

1382
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,360
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia 
kept looking at each other darkly.

1383
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,440
When the mail arrived,

1384
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,280
Uncle Vernon,

1385
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,360
who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry,

1386
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,280
made Dudley go and get it.

1387
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,120
They heard him banging things with his 
Smelting stick all the way down the hall.

1388
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,000
Then he shouted,

1389
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,760
"There's another one! 'Mr. H.

1390
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,520
Potter, The Smallest Bedroom,

1391
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,558
4 Privet Drive ,

1392
00:51:47,558 --> 00:51:47,560
'"

1393
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,800
With a strangled cry,

1394
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,880
Uncle Vernon leapt from his 
seat and ran down the hall,

1395
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,440
Harry right behind him.

1396
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,160
Uncle Vernon had to wrestle Dudley to 
the ground to get the letter from him,

1397
00:51:57,160 --> 00:51:58,240
which was made difficult

1398
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:02,560
by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle 
Vernon around the neck from behind.

1399
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,360
After a minute of confused fighting,

1400
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,240
in which everyone got hit a 
lot by the Smelting stick,

1401
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,920
Uncle Vernon straightened up,

1402
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,160
gasping for breath,

1403
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,280
with Harry's letter clutched in his hand.

1404
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,960
"Go to your cupboard , I mean, your bedroom,"

1405
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,240
he wheezed at Harry.

1406
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,320
"Dudley , go , just go."

1407
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,680
Harry walked round and round his new room.

1408
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:23,160
Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard

1409
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:26,120
and they seemed to know he 
hadn't received his first letter.

1410
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,040
Surely that meant they'd try again?

1411
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,480
And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail.

1412
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,600
He had a plan.

1413
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,040
The repaired alarm clock rang 
at six o'clock the next morning.

1414
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,800
Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently.

1415
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,520
He mustn't wake the Dursleys.

1416
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,720
He stole downstairs without 
turning on any of the lights.

1417
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,840
He was going to wait for the postman 
on the corner of Privet Drive

1418
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,320
and get the letters for number four first.

1419
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:53,520
His heart hammered as he crept across 
the dark hall toward the front door ,

1420
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,920
Harry leapt into the air;

1421
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,520
he'd trodden on something big 
and squashy on the doormat ,

1422
00:52:58,520 --> 00:52:59,680
something alive!

1423
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,760
Lights clicked on upstairs and to his 
horror Harry realized that the big,

1424
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,240
squashy something had been his uncle's face.

1425
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,160
Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot 
of the front door in a sleeping bag,

1426
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,280
clearly making sure that Harry didn't 
do exactly what he'd been trying to do.

1427
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:19,240
He shouted at Harry for about half an hour 
and then told him to go and make a cup of tea.

1428
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:23,280
Harry shuffled miserably off into the 
kitchen and by the time he got back,

1429
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,680
the mail had arrived,

1430
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,560
right into Uncle Vernon's lap.

1431
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:29,320
Harry could see three letters 
addressed in green ink.

1432
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,920
I want , " he began,

1433
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,760
but Uncle Vernon was tearing the 
letters into pieces before his eyes.

1434
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,120
Uncle Vernon didnt go to work that day.

1435
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,880
He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot.

1436
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,320
"See,"

1437
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:43,120
he explained to Aunt Petunia 
through a mouthful of nails,

1438
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,440
"if they can't deliver them they'll just give up."

1439
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,840
"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon."

1440
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,840
"Oh, these people's minds work in strange ways,

1441
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,280
Petunia, they're not like you and me,"

1442
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,440
said Uncle Vernon,

1443
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,520
trying to knock in a nail with the piece of 
fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.

1444
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,920
On Friday, no less than twelve 
letters arrived for Harry.

1445
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,200
As they couldn't go through the mail 
slot they had been pushed under the door,

1446
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,680
slotted through the sides,

1447
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,560
and a few even forced through the small 
window in the downstairs bathroom.

1448
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,640
Uncle Vernon stayed at home again.

1449
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,000
After burning all the letters,

1450
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,640
he got out a hammer and nails

1451
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,160
and boarded up the cracks around the front 
and back doors so no one could go out.

1452
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:20,640
He hummed

1453
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,960
"Tiptoe Through the Tulips"

1454
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,520
as he worked, and jumped at small noises.

1455
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,360
On Saturday,

1456
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,240
things began to get out of hand.

1457
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,960
Twenty-four letters to Harry 
found their way into the house,

1458
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,760
rolled up and hidden inside 
each of the two dozen eggs

1459
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,280
that their very confused milkman had handed 
Aunt Petunia through the living room window.

1460
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,760
While Uncle Vernon made furious 
telephone calls to the post office

1461
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,640
and the dairy trying to 
find someone to complain to,

1462
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,600
Aunt Petunia shredded the 
letters in her food processor.

1463
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:48,880
"Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?"

1464
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:50,960
Dudley asked Harry in amazement.

1465
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,000
On Sunday morning,

1466
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,040
Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table 
looking tired and rather ill, but happy.

1467
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,400
"No post on Sundays,"

1468
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,920
he reminded them cheerfully as he 
spread marmalade on his newspapers,

1469
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,720
"no damn letters today , "

1470
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,320
Something came whizzing down 
the kitchen chimney as he spoke

1471
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,760
and caught him sharply on the back of the head.

1472
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,720
Next moment,

1473
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,680
thirty or forty letters came pelting 
out of the fireplace like bullets.

1474
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,840
The Dursleys ducked,

1475
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,760
but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one.

1476
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,280
"Out! OUT!"

1477
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,920
Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the 
waist and threw him into the hall.

1478
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,680
When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run 
out with their arms over their faces,

1479
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,800
Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut.

1480
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:31,360
They could hear the letters 
still streaming into the room,

1481
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,480
bouncing off the walls and floor.

1482
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,080
"That does it,"

1483
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,200
said Uncle Vernon,

1484
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,920
trying to speak calmly but pulling great 
tufts out of his mustache at the same time.

1485
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,800
I want you all back here in 
five minutes ready to leave.

1486
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,040
We're going away.

1487
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,640
Just pack some clothes.

1488
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,920
No arguments!"

1489
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:51,200
He looked so dangerous with half his 
mustache missing that no one dared argue.

1490
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,160
Ten minutes later they had wrenched 
their way through the boarded-up doors

1491
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,280
and were in the car,

1492
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,960
speeding toward the highway.

1493
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,040
Dudley was sniffling in the back seat;

1494
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,840
his father had hit him round the head 
for holding them up while he tried

1495
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,280
to pack his television,

1496
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,120
VCR, and computer in his sports bag.

1497
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,120
They drove.

1498
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,200
And they drove.

1499
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,120
Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare 
ask where they were going.

1500
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,840
Every now and then Uncle 
Vernon would take a sharp turn

1501
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,600
and drive in the opposite direction for a while.

1502
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,640
"Shake'em off... shake 'em off,"

1503
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,480
he would mutter whenever he did this.

1504
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,840
They didn't stop to eat or drink all day.

1505
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,720
By nightfall Dudley was howling.

1506
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,240
He'd never had such a bad day in his life.

1507
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,000
He was hungry,

1508
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,040
he'd missed five television 
programs he'd wanted to see,

1509
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,280
and he'd never gone so long without 
blowing up an alien on his computer.

1510
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,480
Uncle Vernon stopped at last 
outside a gloomy-looking hotel

1511
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,440
on the outskirts of a big city.

1512
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,400
Dudley and Harry shared a 
room with twin beds and damp,

1513
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,640
musty sheets.

1514
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,640
Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake,

1515
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,000
sitting on the windowsill,

1516
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,640
staring down at the lights of 
passing cars and wondering....

1517
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:56,200
They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned 
tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day.

1518
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,560
They had just finished when the owner 
of the hotel came over to their table.

1519
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:00,320
"'Scuse me,

1520
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,640
but is one of you Mr. H. Potter?

1521
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,480
Only I got about an 'undred 
of these at the front desk."

1522
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:09,160
She held up a letter so they 
could read the green ink address:

1523
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,360
Mr. H. Potter

1524
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,160
Room 17

1525
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,200
Railview Hotel

1526
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,080
Cokeworth

1527
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:17,120
Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle 
Vernon knocked his hand out of the way.

1528
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:18,360
The woman stared.

1529
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,200
"I'll take them,"

1530
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,400
said Uncle Vernon,

1531
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,400
standing up quickly and following 
her from the dining room.

1532
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,280
Wouldn't it be better just to go home,

1533
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,840
dear?" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly,

1534
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,840
hours later,

1535
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,320
but Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.

1536
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,120
Exactly what he was looking for,

1537
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,240
none of them knew.

1538
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,560
He drove them into the middle of a forest,

1539
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,120
got out, looked around,

1540
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,240
shook his head,

1541
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,560
got back in the car,

1542
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,040
and off they went again.

1543
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,720
The same thing happened in 
the middle of a plowed field,

1544
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,760
halfway across a suspension bridge,

1545
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,400
and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.

1546
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,520
"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?"

1547
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,560
Dudley asked Aunt Petunia 
dully late that afternoon.

1548
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,120
Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast,

1549
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,480
locked them all inside the car,

1550
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,720
and disappeared.

1551
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,040
It started to rain.

1552
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,280
Great drops beat on the roof of the car.

1553
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,560
Dud ley sniveled.

1554
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,200
"It's Monday,"

1555
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,440
he told his mother.

1556
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,520
"The Great Humberto's on tonight.

1557
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:12,000
I want to stay somewhere 
with a television. " Monday.

1558
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,960
This reminded Harry of something.

1559
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,040
If it was Monday ,

1560
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:18,200
and you could usually count on 
Dudley to know the days the week,

1561
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,800
because of television ,

1562
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:20,520
then tomorrow,

1563
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,080
Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday.

1564
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:26,200
Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun ,

1565
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:31,440
last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat 
hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon's old socks.

1566
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,600
Still, you weren't eleven every day.

1567
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,280
Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling.

1568
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:38,120
He was also carrying a long,

1569
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:42,080
thin package and didn't answer Aunt 
Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.

1570
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,320
"Found the perfect place!" he said.

1571
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,200
"Come on! Everyone out!"

1572
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,440
It was very cold outside the car.

1573
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,280
Uncle Vernon was pointing at what 
looked like a large rock way out at sea.

1574
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,480
Perched on top of the rock was the most 
miserable little shack you could imagine.

1575
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,560
One thing was certain,

1576
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,840
there was no television in there.

1577
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,720
"Storm forecast for tonight!"

1578
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:05,520
said Uncle Vernon gleefully, 
clapping his hands together.

1579
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:08,600
"And this gentleman's kindly 
agreed to lend us his boat!"

1580
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,160
A toothless old man came ambling up to them,

1581
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,600
pointing, with a rather wicked grin,

1582
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:17,040
at an old rowboat bobbing in 
the iron-gray water below them.

1583
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,560
"I've already got us some rations,"

1584
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,680
said Uncle Vernon,

1585
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,920
"so all aboard!"

1586
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,520
It was freezing in the boat.

1587
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:27,120
Icy sea spray and rain crept down their 
necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces.

1588
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,520
After what seemed like 
hours they reached the rock,

1589
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,680
where Uncle Vernon,

1590
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:31,960
slipping and sliding,

1591
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,200
led the way to the broken-down house.

1592
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,560
The inside was horrible;

1593
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,520
it smelled strongly of seaweed,

1594
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,960
the wind whistled through 
the gaps in the wooden walls,

1595
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:42,360
and the fireplace was damp and empty.

1596
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,040
There were only two rooms.

1597
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:48,560
Uncle Vernon's rations turned out to be 
a bag of chips each and four bananas.

1598
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:52,840
He tried to start a fire but the empty 
chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.

1599
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,160
"Could do with some of those letters now, eh?"

1600
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:56,040
he said cheerfully.

1601
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,480
He was in a very good mood.

1602
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,280
Obviously he thought nobody stood 
a chance of reaching them here

1603
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,040
in a storm to deliver mail.

1604
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:05,000
Harry privately agreed,

1605
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,160
though the thought didn't cheer him up at all.

1606
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,080
As night fell,

1607
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,200
the promised storm blew up around them.

1608
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:13,200
Spray from the high waves 
splattered the walls of the hut

1609
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:16,000
and a fierce wind rattled the filthy windows.

1610
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,120
Aunt Petunia found a few moldy 
blankets in the second room

1611
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:22,120
and made up a bed for Dudley 
on the moth-eaten sofa.

1612
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,120
She and Uncle Vernon went off 
to the lumpy bed next door,

1613
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,040
and Harry was left to find the 
softest bit of floor he could

1614
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,920
and to curl up under the thinnest,

1615
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,520
most ragged blanket.

1616
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,080
The storm raged more and more 
ferociously as the night went on.

1617
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,440
Harry couldn't sleep.

1618
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,960
He shivered and turned over,

1619
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,360
trying to get comfortable,

1620
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,160
his stomach rumbling with hunger.

1621
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:45,880
Dudley's snores were drowned by the low 
rolls of thunder that started near midnight.

1622
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,840
The lighted dial of Dudley's watch,

1623
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,840
which was dangling over the edge 
of the sofa on his fat wrist,

1624
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,600
told Harry he'd be eleven in ten minutes' time.

1625
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,040
He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer,

1626
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,280
wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all,

1627
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,440
wondering where the letter writer was now.

1628
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,720
Five minutes to go.

1629
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,800
Harry heard something creak outside.

1630
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,040
He hoped the roof wasn't going to fall in,

1631
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,160
although he might be warmer if it did.

1632
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,480
Four minutes to go.

1633
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,240
Maybe the house in Privet Drive 
would be so full of letters

1634
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,360
when they got back that he'd 
be able to steal one somehow.

1635
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:16,680
Three minutes to go.

1636
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,640
Was that the sea,

1637
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,680
slapping hard on the rock like that?

1638
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:22,960
And (two minutes to go) what 
was that funny crunching noise?

1639
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,960
Was the rock crumbling into the sea?

1640
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:27,480
One minute to go and he'd be eleven.

1641
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,000
Thirty seconds... twenty ... ten...

1642
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,160
nine , maybe he'd wake Dudley up,

1643
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,640
just to annoy him , three...

1644
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,080
two... one... BOOM.

1645
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,800
The whole shack shivered 
and Harry sat bolt upright,

1646
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,200
staring at the door.

1647
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:41,360
Someone was outside,

1648
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,800
knocking to come in.

1649
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,920
CHAPTER FOUR

1650
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,360
THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS

1651
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,680
BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.

1652
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,720
"Where's the cannon?"

1653
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,160
he said stupidly.

1654
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:55,040
There was a crash behind them and Uncle 
Vernon came skidding into the room.

1655
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,120
He was holding a rifle in his hands ,

1656
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,000
now they knew what had been in the long,

1657
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,040
thin package he had brought with them.

1658
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:01,840
"Who's there?"

1659
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:02,760
he shouted.

1660
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,520
"I warn you , I'm armed!"

1661
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,640
There was a pause. Then , SMASH!

1662
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,960
The door was hit with such force 
that it swung clean off its hinges

1663
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:13,880
and with a deafening crash 
landed flat on the floor.

1664
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,520
A giant of a man was standing in the doorway.

1665
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,360
His face was almost completely hidden by a long,

1666
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,480
shaggy mane of hair and a wild,

1667
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,560
tangled beard,

1668
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,000
but you could make out his eyes,

1669
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,720
glinting like black beetles under all the hair.

1670
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,760
The giant squeezed his way into the hut,

1671
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:31,440
stooping so that his head 
just brushed the ceiling.

1672
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,440
He bent down,

1673
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,480
picked up the door,

1674
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,880
and fitted it easily back into its frame.

1675
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,440
The noise of the storm outside dropped a little.

1676
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,000
He turned to look at them all.

1677
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,520
"Couldn't make us a cup o' tea, could yeh?

1678
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,240
It's not been an easy journey..."

1679
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,720
He strode over to the sofa where 
Dudley sat frozen with fear.

1680
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,400
"Budge up, yeh great lump,"

1681
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,600
said the stranger.

1682
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,400
Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother,

1683
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,520
who was crouching,

1684
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,000
terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.

1685
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,200
"An' here's Harry!"

1686
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,320
said the giant.

1687
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,960
Harry looked up into the fierce,

1688
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:05,720
wild, shadowy face and saw that the 
beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.

1689
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,080
"Las' time I saw you, you was only a baby,"

1690
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:09,160
said the giant.

1691
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,440
"Yeh look a lot like yet dad, 
but yeh've got yet mom's eyes."

1692
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,000
Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.

1693
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,760
I demand that you leave at once, sit!

1694
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,920
" he said. "

1695
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,720
You are breaking and entering!"

1696
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,920
"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,"

1697
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,920
said the giant;

1698
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:27,440
he reached over the back of the sofa,

1699
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:29,800
jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon's hands,

1700
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,120
bent it into a knot as easily as 
if it had been made of rubber,

1701
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,120
and threw it into a corner of the room.

1702
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:39,120
Uncle Vernon made another funny 
noise, like a mouse being trodden on.

1703
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,160
"Anyway , Harry,"

1704
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,960
said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys,

1705
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,840
"a very happy birthday to yeh.

1706
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,360
Got summat fer yeh here ,

1707
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,920
I mighta sat on it at some point,

1708
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:50,480
but it'll taste all right."

1709
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,480
From an inside pocket of his black 
overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box.

1710
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,760
Harry opened it with trembling fingers.

1711
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,960
Inside was a large,

1712
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,120
sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday 
Harry written on it in green icing.

1713
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,720
Harry looked up at the giant.

1714
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,160
He meant to say thank you,

1715
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,520
but the words got lost on the way to his mouth,

1716
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,040
and what he said instead was,

1717
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,000
"Who are you?"

1718
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,320
The giant chuckled.

1719
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,560
"True, I haven't introduced meself.

1720
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,680
Rubeus Hagrid,

1721
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:18,560
Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts."

1722
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,840
He held out an enormous hand 
and shook Harry's whole arm.

1723
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,800
"What about that tea then, eh?"

1724
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,120
he said, rubbing his hands together.

1725
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:29,760
"I'd not say no ter summat 
stronger if yeh've got it, mind."

1726
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,960
His eyes fell on the empty grate with the 
shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted.

1727
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,800
He bent down over the fireplace;

1728
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,160
they couldn't see what he was doing 
but when he drew back a second later,

1729
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,920
there was a roaring fire there.

1730
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:43,120
It filled the whole damp hut with flickering light

1731
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:47,320
and Harry felt the warmth wash over him 
as though he'd sunk into a hot bath.

1732
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,440
The giant sat back down on the sofa,

1733
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,040
which sagged under his weight,

1734
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:55,720
and began taking all sorts of things out of 
the pockets of his coat: a copper kettle,

1735
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,800
a squashy package of sausages,

1736
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,560
a poker, a teapot,

1737
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,160
several chipped mugs,

1738
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:05,520
and a bottle of some amber liquid that he 
took a swig from before starting to make tea.

1739
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,000
Soon the hut was full of the sound 
and smell of sizzling sausage.

1740
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,520
Nobody said a thing while the giant was working,

1741
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:13,640
but as he slid the first six fat,

1742
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,840
juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker,

1743
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,480
Dudley fidgeted a little.

1744
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:20,120
Uncle Vernon said sharply,

1745
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,680
"Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley."

1746
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,280
The giant chuckled darkly.

1747
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,560
"Yet great puddin' of a son 
don' need fattenin' anymore,

1748
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,360
Dursley, don' worry."

1749
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,200
He passed the sausages to Harry,

1750
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:35,960
who was so hungry he had never 
tasted anything so wonderful,

1751
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,640
but he still couldn't take his eyes off the giant.

1752
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:41,520
Finally, as nobody seemed 
about to explain anything,

1753
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,360
he said, "I'm sorry, but I still 
don't really know who you are."

1754
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:49,880
The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped 
his mouth with the back of his hand.

1755
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:50,840
"Call me Hagrid,"

1756
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:52,840
he said, "everyone does.

1757
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,280
An' like I told yeh,

1758
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:56,520
I'm Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts ,

1759
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:59,360
yeh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' course.

1760
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,080
"Er , no,"

1761
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:01,000
said Harry.

1762
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,440
Hagrid looked shocked.

1763
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:02,960
"Sorry,"

1764
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:04,360
Harry said quickly.

1765
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,080
"Sony?"

1766
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,080
barked Hagrid,

1767
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,800
turning to stare at the Dursleys,

1768
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,840
who shrank back into the shadows.

1769
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,400
"It' s them as should be sorry!

1770
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,440
I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but

1771
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,000
I never thought yeh wouldn't 
even know abou' Hogwarts,

1772
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,840
fer cryin' out loud!

1773
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:20,120
Did yeh never wonder where 
yet parents learned it all?"

1774
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:20,960
"All what?"

1775
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,000
asked Harry.

1776
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,840
"ALL WHAT?"

1777
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,000
Hagrid thundered.

1778
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,600
"Now wait jus' one second!"

1779
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,960
He had leapt to his feet.

1780
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:29,360
In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut.

1781
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,720
The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.

1782
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,840
"Do you mean ter tell me,"

1783
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,320
he growled at the Dursleys,

1784
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:38,120
"that this boy , this boy! , knows 
nothin' abou' , about ANYTHING?"

1785
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,280
Harry thought this was going a bit far.

1786
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,240
He had been to school,

1787
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:43,720
after all, and his marks weren't bad.

1788
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:45,520
"I know some things," he said.

1789
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,240
"I can, you know, do math and stuff."

1790
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,880
But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said,

1791
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:56,200
"About our world, I mean. Your 
world. My world. Yer parents' world."

1792
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,120
"What world?"

1793
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,480
Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.

1794
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,160
"DURSLEY!" he boomed.

1795
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:02,120
Uncle Vernon,

1796
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,680
who had gone very pale,

1797
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,080
whispered something that sounded like

1798
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,280
"Mimblewimble."

1799
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,200
Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.

1800
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,960
"But yeh must know about 
yet mom and dad," he said.

1801
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,080
"I mean, they're famous. You're famous."

1802
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,240
"What? My , my mom and dad 
weren't famous, were they?"

1803
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,240
"Yeh don' know... yeh don' know..."

1804
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:22,920
Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair,

1805
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,740
fixing Harry with a bewildered stare.

1806
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,960
"Yeh don' know what yeh are?"

1807
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,160
he said finally.

1808
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,680
Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.

1809
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,240
"Stop!"

1810
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,320
he commanded.

1811
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:35,920
"Stop right there, sit! I forbid 
you to tell the boy anything!"

1812
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,280
A braver man than Vernon 
Dursley would have quailed

1813
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:40,720
under the furious look Hagrid now gave him;

1814
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,920
when Hagrid spoke,

1815
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,200
his every syllable trembled with rage.

1816
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,400
"You never told him?

1817
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:48,880
Never told him what was in the 
letter Dumbledore left fer him?

1818
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,880
I was there!

1819
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,240
I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley!

1820
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,240
An' you've kept it from him all these years?"

1821
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,520
"Kept what from me?"

1822
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:56,880
said Harry eagerly.

1823
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,640
"STOP! I FORBID YOU!"

1824
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,560
yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.

1825
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,840
Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.

1826
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,360
"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of yeh,"

1827
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,400
said Hagrid.

1828
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,040
"Harry , yet a wizard."

1829
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:10,040
There was silence inside the hut.

1830
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,960
Only the sea and the 
whistling wind could be heard.

1831
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:13,800
", a what?"

1832
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,880
gasped Harry.

1833
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,560
"A wizard, o' course,"

1834
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,520
said Hagrid,

1835
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,280
sitting back down on the sofa,

1836
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,720
which groaned and sank even lower,

1837
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,800
"an' a thumpin' good'un,

1838
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,720
I'd say, once yeh've been trained up a bit.

1839
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:28,320
With a mum an' dad like yours,

1840
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,640
what else would yeh be?

1841
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:32,520
An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter."

1842
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,960
Harry stretched out his hand at 
last to take the yellowish envelope,

1843
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,480
addressed in emerald green to Mr. H.

1844
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,080
Potter, The Floor,

1845
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,040
Hut-on-the-Rock, The Sea.

1846
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,440
He pulled out the letter and read:

1847
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,120
HOGWARTS SCHOOL of WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY

1848
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,480
Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

1849
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,520
(Order of Merlin,

1850
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,480
First Class,

1851
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,520
Grand Sorc., Chf.

1852
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,520
Warlock, Supreme Mugwump,

1853
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:56,960
International Confed.

1854
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,480
of Wizards)

1855
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:00,160
Dear Mr. Potter,

1856
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:04,120
We are pleased to inform you that you have 
been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft

1857
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,240
and Wizardry.

1858
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,920
Please find enclosed a list of 
all necessary books and equipment.

1859
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,200
Term begins on September 1.

1860
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,280
We await your owl by no later than July 31.

1861
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:15,760
Yours sincerely,

1862
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,120
Minerva McGonagall,

1863
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:18,680
Deputy Headmistress

1864
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:22,640
Questions exploded inside Harry's head 
like fireworks and he couldn't decide

1865
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,120
which to ask first.

1866
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,360
After a few minutes he stammered,

1867
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:28,160
"What does it mean, they await my owl?"

1868
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,400
"Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me,"

1869
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,400
said Hagrid,

1870
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:35,200
clapping a hand to his forehead with 
enough force to knock over a cart horse,

1871
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,960
and from yet another pocket inside 
his overcoat he pulled an owl ,

1872
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,400
a real, live,

1873
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:41,720
rather ruffled-looking owl ,

1874
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,760
a long quill,

1875
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,360
and a roll of parchment.

1876
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:49,000
With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled 
a note that Harry could read upside down:

1877
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,840
Dear Professor Dumbledore,

1878
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:52,320
Given Harry his letter.

1879
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,320
Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.

1880
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,480
Weather's horrible. Hope you're Well.

1881
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:57,320
Hagrid

1882
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:58,840
Hagrid rolled up the note,

1883
01:09:58,840 --> 01:09:59,960
gave it to the owl,

1884
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,440
which clamped it in its beak,

1885
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,440
went to the door,

1886
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:04,320
and threw the owl out into the storm.

1887
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,800
Then he came back and sat down as though this 
was as normal as talking on the telephone.

1888
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:12,120
Harry realized his mouth was 
open and closed it quickly.

1889
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:12,920
"Where was I?"

1890
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,920
said Hagrid,

1891
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,000
but at that moment,

1892
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Uncle Vernon,

1893
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,840
still ashen-faced but looking very angry,

1894
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,440
moved into the firelight.

1895
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,080
"He's not going," he said.

1896
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,240
Hagrid grunted.

1897
01:10:23,240 --> 01:10:26,280
"I'd like ter see a great Muggle 
like you stop him," he said.

1898
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:26,960
"A what?"

1899
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,600
said Harry, interested.

1900
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:29,200
"A Muggle,"

1901
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,120
said Hagrid,

1902
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:32,440
"it's what we call nonmagic folk like thern.

1903
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,720
An' it's your bad luck you grew up 
in a family o' the biggest Muggles

1904
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,280
I ever laid eyes on."

1905
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,320
"We swore when we took him in 
we'd put a stop to that rubbish,"

1906
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,520
said Uncle Vernon,

1907
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,600
"swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!"

1908
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:45,200
"You knew?"

1909
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,200
said Harry.

1910
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:47,880
"You knew I'm a , a wizard?"

1911
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:48,440
"Knew!"

1912
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:51,120
shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. "Knew!

1913
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:52,320
Of course we knew!

1914
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,520
How could you not be,

1915
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:55,240
my dratted sister being what she was?

1916
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,160
Oh, she got a letter just like that

1917
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:01,640
and disappeared off to that-that 
school-and came home every vacation

1918
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,720
with her pockets full of frog spawn,

1919
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,600
turning teacups into rats.

1920
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,680
I was the only one who saw her 
for what she was , a freak!

1921
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,400
But for my mother and father,

1922
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,920
oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that,

1923
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,880
they were proud of having a witch in the family!"

1924
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:19,000
She stopped to draw a deep 
breath and then went ranting on.

1925
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,600
It seemed she had been wanting 
to say all this for years.

1926
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:27,080
"Then she met that Potter at school and 
they left and got married and had you,

1927
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,280
and of course I knew you'd be just the same,

1928
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:30,480
just as strange,

1929
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:31,760
just as , as ,

1930
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,680
abnormal , and then,

1931
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:33,640
if you please,

1932
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,120
she went and got herself blown 
up and we got landed with you!"

1933
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,920
Harry had gone very white. As soon 
as he found his voice he said,

1934
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,040
"Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!"

1935
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:45,480
"CAR CRASH!"

1936
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:46,480
roared Hagrid,

1937
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,080
jumping up so angrily that the 
Dursleys scuttled back to their corner.

1938
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,920
"How could a car crash kill Lily an' James Potter?

1939
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,280
It's an outrage! A scandal!

1940
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:59,800
Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when 
every kid in our world knows his name!"

1941
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,600
"But why? What happened?"

1942
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,080
Harry asked urgently.

1943
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:07,160
The anger faded from Hagrid's 
face. He looked suddenly anxious.

1944
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,440
"I never expected this,"

1945
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,000
he said, in a low, worried voice.

1946
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,280
"I had no idea,

1947
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:15,840
when Dumbledore told me there might 
be trouble gettin' hold of yeh,

1948
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,400
how much yeh didn't know.

1949
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,080
Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm 
the right person ter tell yeh ,

1950
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,240
but someone 3 s gotta ,

1951
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,480
yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'."

1952
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:27,760
He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.

1953
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,660
"Well, it's best yeh know 
as much as I can tell yeh ,

1954
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:32,920
mind, I can't tell yeh everythin',

1955
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,200
it's a great myst'ry,

1956
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,560
parts of it...."

1957
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,880
He sat down, stared into the fire 
for a few seconds, and then said,

1958
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,360
"It begins,

1959
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,560
I suppose, with ,

1960
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,880
with a person called ,

1961
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,120
but it's incredible yeh don't know his name,

1962
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:48,239
everyone in our world knows ,

1963
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:48,240
"

1964
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:48,960
"Who? "

1965
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,440
"Well , I don' like sayin' the name 
if I can help it. No one does."

1966
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,240
"Why not?"

1967
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:55,120
"Gulpin' gargoyles,

1968
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,800
Harry, people are still scared.

1969
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,880
Blimey, this is difficult.

1970
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,680
See, there was this wizard who went... bad.

1971
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:05,040
As bad as you could go. Worse.

1972
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,400
Worse than worse.

1973
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,960
His name was..."

1974
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,480
Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.

1975
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,800
"Could you write it down?"

1976
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,120
Harry suggested.

1977
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:16,280
"Nah -can't spell it. All right , Voldemort. "

1978
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:17,440
Hagrid shuddered.

1979
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,160
"Don' make me say it again.

1980
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,320
Anyway, this ,

1981
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,120
this wizard,

1982
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,720
about twenty years ago now,

1983
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,120
started lookin' fer followers.

1984
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:26,960
Got 'em, too ,

1985
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,040
some were afraid,

1986
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,120
some just wanted a bit o' his power,

1987
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:33,360
'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right.

1988
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,040
Dark days, Harry.

1989
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,520
Didn't know who ter trust,

1990
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,560
didn't dare get friendly with 
strange wizards or witches...

1991
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:41,120
terrible things happened.

1992
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,680
He was takin' over.

1993
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,320
'Course, some stood up to him ,

1994
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,560
an' he killed 'em. Horribly.

1995
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,800
One o' the only safe places left was Hogwarts.

1996
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,160
Reckon Dumbledore's the only 
one You-Know-Who was afraid of.

1997
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:55,040
Didn't dare try takin' the school,

1998
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,960
not jus' then, anyway.

1999
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,760
"Now, yer mum an' dad were as good 
a witch an' wizard as I ever knew.

2000
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:03,160
Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in their day!

2001
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:07,960
Suppose the myst'ry is why You-Know-Who 
never tried to get 'em on his side before...

2002
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:11,560
probably knew they were too close ter 
Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do

2003
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:12,920
with the Dark Side.

2004
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,880
"Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em...

2005
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:17,000
maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way.

2006
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,240
All anyone knows is,

2007
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,440
he turned up in the village 
where you was all living,

2008
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,400
on Halloween ten years ago.

2009
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,840
You was just a year old.

2010
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:24,960
He came ter yer house an' ,

2011
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,960
an' , "

2012
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:28,360
Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty,

2013
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:32,240
spotted handkerchief and blew his 
nose with a sound like a foghorn.

2014
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:33,560
"Sorry," he said.

2015
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,520
"But it's that sad ,

2016
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:35,920
knew yer mum an' dad,

2017
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,720
an' nicer people yeh couldn't find ,

2018
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:39,360
anyway..."

2019
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:41,040
"You-Know-Who killed 'em.

2020
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,720
An' then , an' this is the 
real myst'ry of the thing ,

2021
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:45,520
he tried to kill you, too.

2022
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,440
Wanted ter make a clean job of it,

2023
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:50,520
I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then.

2024
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,840
But he couldn't do it.

2025
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,400
Never wondered how you got 
that mark on yer forehead?

2026
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,160
That was no ordinary cut.

2027
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:57,840
That's what yeh get when a Powerful,

2028
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,360
evil curse touches yeh ,

2029
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,480
took care of yer mum an' dad an' yer house,

2030
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:03,520
even , but it didn't work on you,

2031
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:05,680
an' that's why yer famous, Harry.

2032
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:08,600
No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em,

2033
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:09,800
no one except you,

2034
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,040
an' he'd killed some o' the best 
witches an' wizards of the age ,

2035
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,000
the McKinnons,

2036
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,600
the Bones, the Prewetts ,

2037
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,360
an' you was only a baby,

2038
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:18,480
an' you lived."

2039
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,480
Something very painful was 
going on in Harry's mind.

2040
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:23,560
As Hagrid's story came to a close,

2041
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:26,200
he saw again the blinding flash of green light,

2042
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:28,880
more clearly than he had 
ever remembered it before ,

2043
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,400
and he remembered something else,

2044
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,040
for the first time in his life: a high,

2045
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:34,800
cold, cruel laugh.

2046
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,760
Hagrid was watching him sadly.

2047
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,720
"Took yeh from the ruined house myself,

2048
01:15:38,720 --> 01:15:40,320
on Dumbledore's orders.

2049
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,240
Brought yeh ter this lot..."

2050
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,400
"Load of old tosh,"

2051
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,600
said Uncle Vernon.

2052
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:45,520
Harry jumped;

2053
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,720
he had almost forgotten that 
the Dursleys were there.

2054
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:51,880
Uncle Vernon certainly seemed 
to have got back his courage.

2055
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:55,040
He was glaring at Hagrid 
and his fists were clenched.

2056
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,880
"Now, you listen here, boy,"

2057
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:57,800
he snarled,

2058
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,000
"I accept there's something strange about you,

2059
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,440
probably nothing a good 
beating wouldn't have cured ,

2060
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,480
and as for all this about your parents,

2061
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:05,960
well, they were weirdos,

2062
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:07,240
no denying it,

2063
01:16:07,240 --> 01:16:09,720
and the world's better off 
without them in my opinion ,

2064
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,080
asked for all they got,

2065
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:13,160
getting mixed up with these wizarding types ,

2066
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,600
just what I expected,

2067
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,079
always knew they'd come to a sticky end ,

2068
01:16:17,079 --> 01:16:17,080
"

2069
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,040
But at that moment,

2070
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:22,760
Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a 
battered pink umbrella from inside his coat.

2071
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,960
Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword,

2072
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,840
he said, "I'm warning you, Dursley 
-I'm warning you , one more word... "

2073
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:33,480
In danger of being speared on the end 
of an umbrella by a bearded giant,

2074
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,560
Uncle Vernon's courage failed again;

2075
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,720
he flattened himself against 
the wall and fell silent.

2076
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:39,400
"That's better,"

2077
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,320
said Hagrid,

2078
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:43,240
breathing heavily and sitting 
back down on the sofa,

2079
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:45,720
which this time sagged right down to the floor.

2080
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:49,680
Harry, meanwhile, still had 
questions to ask, hundreds of them.

2081
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:53,680
"But what happened to Vol, , 
sorry , I mean, You-Know-Who?"

2082
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,080
"Good question, Harry.

2083
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,040
Disappeared. Vanished.

2084
01:16:57,040 --> 01:16:58,920
Same night he tried ter kill you.

2085
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,680
Makes yeh even more famous.

2086
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:02,720
That's the biggest myst'ry, see...

2087
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,880
he was gettin' more an' more powerful ,

2088
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:05,880
why'd he go?

2089
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,240
"Some say he died.

2090
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,080
Codswallop,

2091
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,280
in my opinion.

2092
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,640
Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die.

2093
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,280
Some say he's still out there,

2094
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,440
bidin' his time,

2095
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:16,360
like, but I don' believe it.

2096
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:18,920
People who was on his side came back ter ours.

2097
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:21,120
Some of 'em came outta kinda trances.

2098
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:23,960
Don~ reckon they could've 
done if he was comin' back.

2099
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:27,520
"Most of us reckon he's still out 
there somewhere but lost his powers.

2100
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:29,040
Too weak to carry on.

2101
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,680
'Cause somethin' about you finished him, Harry.

2102
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:34,720
There was somethin' goin' on 
that night he hadn't counted on ,

2103
01:17:34,720 --> 01:17:36,000
I dunno what it was,

2104
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:37,040
no one does ,

2105
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,800
but somethin' about you stumped him,

2106
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:39,640
all right."

2107
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:43,360
Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth 
and respect blazing in his eyes,

2108
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,480
but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud,

2109
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,760
felt quite sure there had been a 
horrible mistake. A wizard? Him?

2110
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,400
How could he possibly be?

2111
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,680
He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley,

2112
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:57,320
and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon;

2113
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,960
if he was really a wizard,

2114
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,400
why hadn't they been turned into warty 
toads every time they'd tried to lock him

2115
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,440
in his cupboard?

2116
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:06,360
If he'd once defeated the 
greatest sorcerer in the world,

2117
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,920
how come Dudley had always been able 
to kick him around like a football?

2118
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:10,520
"Hagrid,"

2119
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,720
he said quietly,

2120
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,640
"I think you must have made a mistake.

2121
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:15,280
I don't think I can be a wizard."

2122
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,480
To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.

2123
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:19,120
"Not a wizard, eh?

2124
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:22,440
Never made things happen when 
you was scared or angry?"

2125
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,080
Harry looked into the fire.

2126
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,680
Now he came to think about it...

2127
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:29,880
every odd thing that had ever made his aunt 
and uncle furious with him had happened

2128
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,200
when he, Harry,

2129
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,960
had been upset or angry...

2130
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,640
chased by Dudley's gang,

2131
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:37,080
he had somehow found himself out of their reach...

2132
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,000
dreading going to school 
with that ridiculous haircut,

2133
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
he'd managed to make it grow back...

2134
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,200
and the very last time Dudley had hit him,

2135
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,600
hadn't he got his revenge,

2136
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:47,760
without even realizing he was doing it?

2137
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,880
Hadn't he set a boa constrictor on him?

2138
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,600
Harry looked back at Hagrid,

2139
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:55,120
smiling, and saw that Hagrid 
was positively beaming at him.

2140
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:55,840
"See?"

2141
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:56,960
said Hagrid.

2142
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,920
"Harry Potter,

2143
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:58,840
not a wizard ,

2144
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:02,360
you wait, you'll be right famous at Hogwarts."

2145
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:05,400
But Uncle Vernon wasn't going 
to give in without a fight.

2146
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,000
"Haven't I told you he's not going?" he hissed.

2147
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,920
"He's going to Stonewall High 
and he'll be grateful for it.

2148
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:13,600
I've read those letters and he 
needs all sorts of rubbish ,

2149
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,340
spell books and wands and ,

2150
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:15,640
"

2151
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:18,920
"If he wants ter go, a great 
Muggle like you won't stop him,"

2152
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,160
growled Hagrid.

2153
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:24,480
"Stop Lily an' James Potter' s 
son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad.

2154
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,840
His name's been down ever since he was born.

2155
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:30,560
He's off ter the finest school of 
witchcraft and wizardry in the world.

2156
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,080
Seven years there and he won't know himself.

2157
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:35,040
He'll be with youngsters of his own sort,

2158
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,080
fer a change,

2159
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,140
an' he'll be under the greatest headmaster 
Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled,

2160
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:40,800
"

2161
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:44,600
"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT 
OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!"

2162
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,000
yelled Uncle Vernon.

2163
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,120
But he had finally gone too far.

2164
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:51,040
Hagrid seized his umbrella 
and whirled it over his head,

2165
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:51,600
"NEVER,"

2166
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:52,440
he thundered,

2167
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:57,240
"- INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE- IN- FRONT- OF- ME!"

2168
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,720
He brought the umbrella swishing down 
through the air to point at Dudley ,

2169
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:02,680
there was a flash of violet light,

2170
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:04,360
a sound like a firecracker,

2171
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,520
a sharp squeal,

2172
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:06,800
and the next second,

2173
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:10,680
Dudley was dancing on the spot with 
his hands clasped over his fat bottom,

2174
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,920
howling in pain.

2175
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,400
When he turned his back on them,

2176
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,240
Harry saw a curly pig's tail poking 
through a hole in his trousers.

2177
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:18,680
Uncle Vernon roared.

2178
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,320
Pulling Aunt Petunia and 
Dudley into the other room,

2179
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:25,640
he cast one last terrified look at 
Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.

2180
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,440
Hagrid looked down at his 
umbrella and stroked his beard.

2181
01:20:28,440 --> 01:20:30,040
"Shouldn'ta lost me temper,"

2182
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,080
he said ruefully,

2183
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:32,720
"but it didn't work anyway.

2184
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,640
Meant ter turn him into a pig,

2185
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:39,280
but I suppose he was so much like a pig 
anyway there wasn't much left ter do."

2186
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:42,760
He cast a sideways look at 
Harry under his bushy eyebrows.

2187
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:46,640
"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention 
that ter anyone at Hogwarts," he said.

2188
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,280
"I'm , er ,

2189
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:48,880
not supposed ter do magic,

2190
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,240
strictly speakin'.

2191
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:54,360
I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh 
an' get yer letters to yeh an' stuff ,

2192
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,320
one o' the reasons I was 
so keen ter take on the job

2193
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:59,360
"Why aren't you supposed to do magic?"

2194
01:20:59,360 --> 01:21:00,560
asked Harry.

2195
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:01,600
"Oh, well ,

2196
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,500
I was at Hogwarts meself but I ,

2197
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:04,480
er , got expelled,

2198
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,000
ter tell yeh the truth.

2199
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,280
In me third year.

2200
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,600
They snapped me wand in half an' everything.

2201
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,280
But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper.

2202
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,160
Great man, Dumbledore."

2203
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,440
"Why were you expelled?"

2204
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,240
"It's gettin' late and we've 
got lots ter do tomorrow,"

2205
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,720
said Hagrid loudly.

2206
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,640
"Gotta get up ter town, get 
all yer books an' that."

2207
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,600
He took off his thick black 
coat and threw it to Harry.

2208
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,400
"You can kip under that," he said.

2209
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,360
"Don' mind if it wriggles a bit,

2210
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,120
I think I still got a couple o' 
dormice in one o' the pockets."

2211
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,280
CHAPTER FIVE

2212
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,480
DIAGON ALLEY

2213
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,760
Harry woke early the next morning.

2214
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,320
Although he could tell it was daylight,

2215
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:41,120
he kept his eyes shut tight.

2216
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,760
"It was a dream, he told himself firmly. "

2217
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:48,160
I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to 
tell me I was going to a school for wizards.

2218
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:50,720
When I open my eyes I'll 
be at home in my cupboard."

2219
01:21:50,720 --> 01:21:53,160
There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.

2220
01:21:53,160 --> 01:21:55,480
And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on the door,

2221
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:56,320
Harry thought,

2222
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,040
his heart sinking.

2223
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:00,080
But he still didn't open his eyes.

2224
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,760
It had been such a good dream.

2225
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,160
Tap. Tap. Tap.

2226
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,800
"All right,"

2227
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:05,760
Harry mumbled,

2228
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,800
"I'm getting up."

2229
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,600
He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him.

2230
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,720
The hut was full of sunlight,

2231
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,960
the storm was over,

2232
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,840
Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa,

2233
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,360
and there was an owl rapping 
its claw on the window,

2234
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:20,320
a newspaper held in its beak.

2235
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,880
Harry scrambled to his feet,

2236
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:25,360
so happy he felt as though a large 
balloon was swelling inside him.

2237
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,080
He went straight to the window and jerked it open.

2238
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,520
The owl swooped in and dropped 
the newspaper on top of Hagrid,

2239
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,720
who didn't wake up.

2240
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:36,640
The owl then fluttered onto the floor 
and began to attack Hagrid's coat.

2241
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:37,760
"Don't do that."

2242
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,840
Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way,

2243
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:44,520
but it snapped its beak fiercely at 
him and carried on savaging the coat.

2244
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,280
"Hagrid!"

2245
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,840
said Harry loudly. "There's an owl

2246
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:48,480
"Pay him,"

2247
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,480
Hagrid grunted into the sofa.

2248
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,000
"What?"

2249
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,880
"He wants payin' fer deliverin' 
the paper. Look in the pockets."

2250
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,720
Hagrid's coat seemed to be 
made of nothing but pockets ,

2251
01:22:57,720 --> 01:22:58,920
bunches of keys,

2252
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,080
slug pellets,

2253
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,200
balls of string,

2254
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:03,440
peppermint humbugs, teabags...

2255
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,240
finally, Harry pulled out a 
handful of strange-looking coins.

2256
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:08,360
"Give him five Knuts,"

2257
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,920
said Hagrid sleepily.

2258
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:10,760
"Knuts?"

2259
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:12,400
"The little bronze ones."

2260
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,840
Harry counted out five little bronze coins,

2261
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:20,000
and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put 
the money into a small leather pouch tied to it.

2262
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,040
Then he flew off through the open window.

2263
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,280
Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.

2264
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,320
"Best be Off,

2265
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:28,080
Harry, lots ter do today,

2266
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:31,600
gotta get up ter London an' 
buy all yer stuff fer school."

2267
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,600
Harry was turning over the 
wizard coins and looking at them.

2268
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,320
He had just thought of something

2269
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:40,290
that made him feel as though the happy 
balloon inside him had got a puncture.

2270
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:41,240
"Um , Hagrid?"

2271
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:41,960
"Mm?"

2272
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,800
said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.

2273
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:46,120
"I haven't got any money ,

2274
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:48,080
and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ...

2275
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:50,920
he won't pay for me to go and learn magic."

2276
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:51,960
"Don't worry about that,"

2277
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:54,440
said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head.

2278
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:57,400
"D'yeh think yer parents 
didn't leave yeh anything?"

2279
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,600
"But if their house was destroyed , "

2280
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:02,080
"They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy!

2281
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,320
Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts.

2282
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:06,560
Wizards' bank.

2283
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:07,560
Have a sausage,

2284
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,800
they're not bad cold ,

2285
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:12,160
an' I wouldn' say no teh a 
bit o' yer birthday cake,

2286
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,920
neither."

2287
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:14,360
"Wizards have banks?"

2288
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,800
"Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins."

2289
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,240
Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.

2290
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,360
"Goblins?"

2291
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,680
"Yeah , so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,

2292
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,320
I'll tell yeh that.

2293
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,920
Never mess with goblins, Harry.

2294
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:31,280
Gringotts is the safest place in the world 
fer anything yeh want ter keep safe ,

2295
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,040
'cept maybe Hogwarts.

2296
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,360
As a matter o' fact,

2297
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,400
I gotta visit Gringotts anyway.

2298
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,760
Fer Dumbledore.

2299
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,240
Hogwarts business."

2300
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:41,320
Hagrid drew himself up proudly.

2301
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,960
"He usually gets me ter do 
important stuff fer him.

2302
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:46,240
Fetchin' you gettin' things from Gringotts ,

2303
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:48,440
knows he can trust me, see.

2304
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,400
"Got everythin'? Come on, then."

2305
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,800
Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock.

2306
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,480
The sky was quite clear now and 
the sea gleamed in the sunlight.

2307
01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,000
The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there,

2308
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,680
with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.

2309
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:02,840
"How did you get here?"

2310
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,360
Harry asked, looking around for another boat.

2311
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:05,800
"Flew,"

2312
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:06,800
said Hagrid.

2313
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:07,800
"Flew?"

2314
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,800
"Yeah , but we'll go back in this.

2315
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,560
Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh."

2316
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,080
They settled down in the boat,

2317
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,880
Harry still staring at Hagrid,

2318
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,760
trying to imagine him flying.

2319
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,280
"Seems a shame ter row, though,"

2320
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:22,680
said Hagrid, giving Harry 
another of his sideways looks.

2321
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:23,360
"If I was ter ,

2322
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,920
er , speed things up a bit,

2323
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,480
would yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwarts?"

2324
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:28,480
"Of course not,"

2325
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:29,320
said Harry,

2326
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:30,960
eager to see more magic.

2327
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,200
Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again,

2328
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:35,320
tapped it twice on the side of the boat,

2329
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,200
and they sped off toward land.

2330
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,840
"Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?"

2331
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:41,080
Harry asked.

2332
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,600
"Spells , enchantments,"

2333
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,920
said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke.

2334
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:49,160
"They say there's dragons 
guardin' the highsecurity vaults.

2335
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:50,840
And then yeh gotta find yer way ,

2336
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:53,800
Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see.

2337
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:55,480
Deep under the Underground.

2338
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,600
Yeh'd die of hunger tryin' ter get out,

2339
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,880
even if yeh did manage ter 
get yer hands on summat."

2340
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:04,240
Harry sat and thought about this 
while Hagrid read his newspaper,

2341
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,920
the Daily Prophet.

2342
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:09,360
Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon 
that people liked to be left alone while

2343
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,320
they did this,

2344
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:11,880
but it was very difficult,

2345
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:14,600
he'd never had so many questions in his life.

2346
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,840
"Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual,"

2347
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:20,160
Hagrid muttered, turning the page.

2348
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,840
"There's a Ministry of Magic?"

2349
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,680
Harry asked, before he could stop himself.

2350
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:25,200
"'Course,"

2351
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,160
said Hagrid.

2352
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,240
"They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister,

2353
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:29,200
0 ' course,

2354
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:30,960
but he'd never leave Hogwarts,

2355
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,520
so old Cornelius Fudge got the job.

2356
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:35,200
Bungler if ever there was one.

2357
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:37,600
So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning,

2358
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:39,320
askin' fer advice."

2359
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,560
"But what does a Ministry of Magic do?"

2360
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:44,000
"Well, their main job is 
to keep it from the Muggles

2361
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:47,680
that there's still witches an' 
wizards up an' down the country."

2362
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:48,920
"Why?" "Why?

2363
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,360
Blimey, Harry,

2364
01:26:50,360 --> 01:26:53,600
everyone'd be wantin' magic 
solutions to their problems.

2365
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:55,560
Nah, we're best left alone."

2366
01:26:55,560 --> 01:26:58,520
At this moment the boat bumped 
gently into the harbor wall.

2367
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,400
Hagrid folded up his newspaper,

2368
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,240
and they clambered up the 
stone steps onto the street.

2369
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:07,560
Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they 
walked through the little town to the station.

2370
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,040
Harry couldn't blame them.

2371
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,840
Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else,

2372
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,360
he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary 
things like parking meters and saying loudly,

2373
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:20,200
"See that, Harry? Things 
these Muggles dream up, eh?"

2374
01:27:20,200 --> 01:27:20,880
"Hagrid,"

2375
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:23,600
said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up,

2376
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:26,080
"did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?"

2377
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,240
"Well, so they say,"

2378
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,280
said Hagrid.

2379
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,240
"Crikey, I'd like a dragon."

2380
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,200
"You'd like one?"

2381
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,760
"Wanted one ever since I was a kid , here we go."

2382
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:35,440
They had reached the station.

2383
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,200
There was a train to London in five minutes' time.

2384
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:39,600
Hagrid, who didn't understand

2385
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,520
"Muggle money,"

2386
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:41,600
as he called it,

2387
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,400
gave the bills to Harry so 
he could buy their tickets.

2388
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,600
People stared more than ever on the train.

2389
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:50,920
Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting 
what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.

2390
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:52,800
"Still got yer letter, Harry?"

2391
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,120
he asked as he counted stitches.

2392
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,560
Harry took the parchment 
envelope out of his pocket.

2393
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:57,840
"Good,"

2394
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:58,880
said Hagrid.

2395
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,240
"There's a list there of everything yeh need."

2396
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:05,120
Harry unfolded a second piece of paper 
he hadn't noticed the night before,

2397
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,440
and read:

2423
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,640
"Can we buy all this in London?"

2424
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,080
Harry wondered aloud.

2425
01:29:21,080 --> 01:29:22,000
"If yeh know where to go,"

2426
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,000
said Hagrid.

2427
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,160
Harry had never been to London before.

2428
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:27,280
Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going,

2429
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:30,520
he was obviously not used to 
getting there in an ordinary way.

2430
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:33,120
He got stuck in the ticket 
barrier on the Underground,

2431
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:37,280
and complained loudly that the seats 
were too small and the trains too slow.

2432
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,680
"I don't know how the Muggles 
manage without magic,"

2433
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:43,680
he said as they climbed a broken-down 
escalator that led up to a bustling road lined

2434
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,760
with shops.

2435
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:47,760
Hagrid was so huge that he 
parted the crowd easily;

2436
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,600
all Harry had to do was keep close behind him.

2437
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,800
They passed book shops and music stores,

2438
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,760
hamburger restaurants and cinemas,

2439
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:57,840
but nowhere that looked as if 
it could sell you a magic wand.

2440
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,080
This was just an ordinary 
street full of ordinary people.

2441
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:04,440
Could there really be piles of wizard 
gold buried miles beneath them?

2442
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,560
Were there really shops that 
sold spell books and broomsticks?

2443
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,800
Might this not all be some huge joke 
that the Dursleys had cooked up?

2444
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,840
If Harry hadn't known that the 
Dursleys had no sense of humor,

2445
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,280
he might have thought so;

2446
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:16,200
yet somehow,

2447
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:19,680
even though everything Hagrid had 
told him so far was unbelievable,

2448
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:21,600
Harry couldn't help trusting him.

2449
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,120
"This is it,"

2450
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:24,040
said Hagrid, coming to a halt,

2451
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,840
"the Leaky Cauldron. It's a famous place."

2452
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:27,760
It was a tiny,

2453
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:29,160
grubby-looking pub.

2454
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:30,960
If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out,

2455
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:33,080
Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there.

2456
01:30:33,080 --> 01:30:35,480
The people hurrying by didn't glance at it.

2457
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:39,280
Their eyes slid from the big book shop on 
one side to the record shop on the other

2458
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,840
as if they couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at all.

2459
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:46,600
In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling 
that only he and Hagrid could see it.

2460
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,040
Before he could mention this,

2461
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,960
Hagrid had steered him inside.

2462
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,200
For a famous place,

2463
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:53,200
it was very dark and shabby.

2464
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,400
A few old women were sitting in a corner,

2465
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,680
drinking tiny glasses of sherry.

2466
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,800
One of them was smoking a long pipe.

2467
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:02,880
A little man in a top hat was 
talking to the old bartender,

2468
01:31:02,880 --> 01:31:05,880
who was quite bald and looked 
like a toothless walnut.

2469
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,400
The low buzz of chatter 
stopped when they walked in.

2470
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,080
Everyone seemed to know Hagrid;

2471
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:11,720
they waved and smiled at him,

2472
01:31:11,720 --> 01:31:13,760
and the bartender reached for a glass,

2473
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:16,160
saying, "The usual, Hagrid?"

2474
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,800
"Can't, Tom, I'm on Hogwarts business,"

2475
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:19,640
said Hagrid,

2476
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:24,000
clapping his great hand on Harry's 
shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.

2477
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:24,720
"Good Lord,"

2478
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:27,200
said the bartender, peering at Harry,

2479
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:28,800
"is this , can this be , ?"

2480
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,640
The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly 
gone completely still and silent.

2481
01:31:32,640 --> 01:31:33,680
"Bless my soul,"

2482
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,280
whispered the old bartender,

2483
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:37,320
"Harry Potter... what an honor."

2484
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:39,200
He hurried out from behind the bar,

2485
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:41,600
rushed toward Harry and seized his hand,

2486
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:43,080
tears in his eyes.

2487
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:46,040
"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back."

2488
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,880
Harry didn't know what to say.

2489
01:31:47,880 --> 01:31:49,320
Everyone was looking at him.

2490
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:53,960
The old woman with the pipe was puffing 
on it without realizing it had gone out.

2491
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:55,360
Hagrid was beaming.

2492
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:58,560
Then there was a great scraping 
of chairs and the next moment,

2493
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:02,320
Harry found himself shaking hands 
with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.

2494
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:03,520
"Doris Crockford,

2495
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:04,600
Mr. Potter,

2496
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,640
can't believe I'm meeting you at last."

2497
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:10,040
"So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud."

2498
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:13,040
"Always wanted to shake your 
hand , I'm all of a flutter."

2499
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:13,760
"Delighted,

2500
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:14,760
Mr. Potter,

2501
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:15,840
just can't tell you,

2502
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:16,880
Diggle's the name,

2503
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,160
Dedalus Diggle."

2504
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,560
"I've seen you before!"

2505
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:23,400
said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle's 
top hat fell off in his excitement.

2506
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,240
"You bowed to me once in a shop."

2507
01:32:25,240 --> 01:32:26,160
"He remembers!"

2508
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:29,200
cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone.

2509
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:31,440
"Did you hear that? He remembers me!"

2510
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,440
Harry shook hands again and again ,

2511
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:36,200
Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.

2512
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,520
A pale young man made his way forward,

2513
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:39,880
very nervously.

2514
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,640
One of his eyes was twitching.

2515
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:42,800
"Professor Quirrell!"

2516
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:43,880
said Hagrid.

2517
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:47,480
"Harry, Professor Quirrell will be 
one of your teachers at Hogwarts."

2518
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:48,600
"P-P-Potter,"

2519
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:51,840
stammered Professor Quirrell, 
grasping Harry's hand,

2520
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:55,120
"c-can't t-tell you how p- 
pleased I am to meet you."

2521
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,920
"What sort of magic do you 
teach, Professor Quirrell?"

2522
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:00,080
"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,"

2523
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,560
muttered Professor Quirrell,

2524
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,200
as though he'd rather not think about it.

2525
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,320
"N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?"

2526
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,720
He laughed nervously.

2527
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:11,640
"You'll be g-getting all 
your equipment, I suppose?

2528
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:14,640
I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on vampires,

2529
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:15,760
m-myself."

2530
01:33:15,760 --> 01:33:18,040
He looked terrified at the very thought.

2531
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:21,520
But the others wouldn't let Professor 
Quirrell keep Harry to himself.

2532
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,160
It took almost ten minutes 
to get away from them all.

2533
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:27,640
At last, Hagrid managed to make 
himself heard over the babble.

2534
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:30,840
"Must get on , lots ter buy. Come on, Harry."

2535
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,720
Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time,

2536
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,960
and Hagrid led them through 
the bar and out into a small,

2537
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,200
walled courtyard,

2538
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,280
where there was nothing but 
a trash can and a few weeds.

2539
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:42,880
Hagrid grinned at Harry.

2540
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,600
"Told yeh, didn't I?

2541
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,200
Told yeh you was famous.

2542
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:49,280
Even Professor Quirrell was 
tremblin' ter meet yeh ,

2543
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:50,880
mind you, he's usually tremblin'."

2544
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:53,840
"Is he always that nervous?"

2545
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,400
"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant 
mind. He was fine while he was

2546
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:02,840
studyin' outta books but then he took a year 
off ter get some firsthand experience....

2547
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,480
They say he met vampires in the Black Forest,

2548
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,160
and there was a nasty bit o' trouble with a hag ,

2549
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:09,800
never been the same since.

2550
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:11,040
Scared of the students,

2551
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,000
scared of his own subject now,

2552
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,320
where's me umbrella?" Vampires? Hags?

2553
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,840
Harry's head was swimming.

2554
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:19,200
Hagrid, meanwhile,

2555
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:21,960
was counting bricks in the 
wall above the trash can.

2556
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:24,680
"Three up... two across he muttered. "

2557
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,840
Right, stand back, Harry."

2558
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:30,000
He tapped the wall three times 
with the point of his umbrella.

2559
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,560
The brick he had touched quivered ,

2560
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,280
it wriggled ,

2561
01:34:32,280 --> 01:34:33,080
in the middle,

2562
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:34,440
a small hole appeared ,

2563
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,200
it grew wider and wider ,

2564
01:34:36,200 --> 01:34:40,040
a second later they were facing an 
archway large enough even for Hagrid,

2565
01:34:40,040 --> 01:34:44,320
an archway onto a cobbled street 
that twisted and turned out of sight.

2566
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:44,760
"Welcome,"

2567
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:45,480
said Hagrid,

2568
01:34:45,480 --> 01:34:46,880
"to Diagon Alley."

2569
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,720
He grinned at Harry's amazement.

2570
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,320
They stepped through the archway.

2571
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,040
Harry looked quickly over his shoulder

2572
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:55,520
and saw the archway shrink 
instantly back into solid wall.

2573
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,480
The sun shone brightly on a stack of 
cauldrons outside the nearest shop.

2574
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:00,240
Cauldrons ,

2575
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:01,880
All Sizes - Copper,

2576
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,320
Brass, Pewter,

2577
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,080
Silver , Self-Stirring ,

2578
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:05,480
Collapsible,

2579
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:07,520
said a sign hanging over them.

2580
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,280
"Yeah, you'll be needin' one,"

2581
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:10,240
said Hagrid,

2582
01:35:10,240 --> 01:35:12,200
"but we gotta get yer money first."

2583
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:14,480
Harry wished he had about eight more eyes.

2584
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:17,680
He turned his head in every direction 
as they walked up the street,

2585
01:35:17,680 --> 01:35:20,320
trying to look at everything at once: the shops,

2586
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,720
the things outside them,

2587
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:23,320
the people doing their shopping.

2588
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:27,280
A plump woman outside an Apothecary 
was shaking her head as they passed,

2589
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:31,800
saying, "Dragon liver, seventeen 
Sickles an ounce, they're mad...."

2590
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:36,800
A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop 
with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium ,

2591
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:37,920
Tawny, Screech,

2592
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,240
Barn, Brown, and Snowy.

2593
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:43,840
Several boys of about Harry's age had 
their noses pressed against a window

2594
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,240
with broomsticks in it.

2595
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:45,800
"Look,"

2596
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,280
Harry heard one of them say,

2597
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:50,480
"the new Nimbus Two Thousand , fastest ever , "

2598
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,080
There were shops selling robes,

2599
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:56,640
shops selling telescopes and strange silver 
instruments Harry had never seen before,

2600
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:59,800
windows stacked with barrels 
of bat spleens and eels' eyes,

2601
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,760
tottering piles of spell books,

2602
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,960
quills, and rolls of parchment,

2603
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,240
potion bottles,

2604
01:36:05,240 --> 01:36:06,800
globes of the moon....

2605
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:07,520
"Gringotts,"

2606
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:08,520
said Hagrid.

2607
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:13,360
They had reached a snowy white building 
that towered over the other little shops.

2608
01:36:13,360 --> 01:36:15,600
Standing beside its burnished bronze doors,

2609
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,120
wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold,

2610
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,240
was -

2611
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:20,520
"Yeah, that's a goblin,"

2612
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:24,040
said Hagrid quietly as they walked 
up the white stone steps toward him.

2613
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,760
The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry.

2614
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:27,800
He had a swarthy,

2615
01:36:27,800 --> 01:36:28,680
clever face,

2616
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:30,080
a pointed beard and,

2617
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:31,160
Harry noticed,

2618
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,160
very long fingers and feet.

2619
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,080
He bowed as they walked inside.

2620
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,400
Now they were facing a second pair of doors,

2621
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,560
silver this time,

2622
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,800
with words engraved upon them:

2623
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,240
Enter, stranger, but take heed

2624
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,480
Of what awaits the sin of greed,

2625
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:47,680
For those who take, but do not earn,

2626
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:49,880
Must pay most dearly in their turn.

2627
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,920
So if you seek beneath our floors

2628
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,680
A treasure that was never yours,

2629
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:55,840
Thief, you have been warned, beware

2630
01:36:55,840 --> 01:36:57,720
Of finding more than treasure there.

2631
01:36:57,720 --> 01:37:00,240
"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,"

2632
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:01,240
said Hagrid.

2633
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:06,280
A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver 
doors and they were in a vast marble hall.

2634
01:37:06,280 --> 01:37:10,320
About a hundred more goblins were sitting 
on high stools behind a long counter,

2635
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,960
scribbling in large ledgers,

2636
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,800
weighing coins in brass scales,

2637
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:16,400
examining precious stones through eyeglasses.

2638
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:19,080
There were too many doors to 
count leading off the hall,

2639
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:22,520
and yet more goblins were showing 
people in and out of these.

2640
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:24,520
Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.

2641
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:25,080
"Morning,"

2642
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,000
said Hagrid to a free goblin.

2643
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:30,480
"We've come ter take some money 
outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe."

2644
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:31,920
"You have his key, Sir?"

2645
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:33,120
"Got it here somewhere,"

2646
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,080
said Hagrid,

2647
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:37,240
and he started emptying his 
pockets onto the counter,

2648
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:41,680
scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuits 
over the goblin's book of numbers.

2649
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:43,520
The goblin wrinkled his nose.

2650
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:48,200
Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing 
a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.

2651
01:37:48,200 --> 01:37:48,760
"Got it,"

2652
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:52,120
said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.

2653
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:53,440
The goblin looked at it closely.

2654
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,560
"That seems to be in order."

2655
01:37:55,560 --> 01:37:58,840
"An' I've also got a letter 
here from Professor Dumbledore,"

2656
01:37:58,840 --> 01:38:01,880
said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest.

2657
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:05,080
"It's about the YouKnow-What in 
vault seven hundred and thirteen."

2658
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:07,320
The goblin read the letter carefully.

2659
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:08,040
"Very well,"

2660
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:10,240
he said, handing it back to Hagrid,

2661
01:38:10,240 --> 01:38:13,400
"I will have Someone take you 
down to both vaults. Griphook!"

2662
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:15,880
Griphook was yet another goblin.

2663
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:20,200
Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog 
biscuits back inside his pockets,

2664
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:23,440
he and Harry followed Griphook toward 
one of the doors leading off the hall.

2665
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:27,040
"What's the You-Know-What in 
vault seven hundred and thirteen?"

2666
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,200
Harry asked.

2667
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:29,120
"Can't tell yeh that,"

2668
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:30,960
said Hagrid mysteriously.

2669
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:32,040
"Very secret.

2670
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:33,480
Hogwarts business.

2671
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:35,120
Dumbledore's trusted me.

2672
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,400
More'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that."

2673
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:39,520
Griphook held the door open for them.

2674
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,560
Harry, who had expected more marble,

2675
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:42,800
was surprised.

2676
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:46,320
They were in a narrow stone 
passageway lit with flaming torches.

2677
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:50,360
It sloped steeply downward and there 
were little railway tracks on the floor.

2678
01:38:50,360 --> 01:38:54,320
Griphook whistled and a small cart came 
hurtling up the tracks toward them.

2679
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:55,240
They climbed in ,

2680
01:38:55,240 --> 01:38:56,480
Hagrid with some difficulty ,

2681
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:57,640
and were off.

2682
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:01,400
At first they just hurtled through 
a maze of twisting passages.

2683
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,840
Harry tried to remember,

2684
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:04,120
left, right,

2685
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:05,080
right, left,

2686
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,240
middle fork,

2687
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:07,400
right, left,

2688
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:08,840
but it was impossible.

2689
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:11,280
The rattling cart seemed to know its own way,

2690
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,200
because Griphook wasn't steering.

2691
01:39:13,200 --> 01:39:15,880
Harry's eyes stung as the 
cold air rushed past them,

2692
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,680
but he kept them wide open.

2693
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:22,160
Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at 
the end of a passage and twisted around to see

2694
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:23,400
if it was a dragon,

2695
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:25,960
but too late - - they plunged even deeper,

2696
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,120
passing an underground lake

2697
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:31,360
where huge stalactites and stalagmites 
grew from the ceiling and floor.

2698
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,000
I never know,

2699
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,920
" Harry called to Hagrid 
over the noise of the cart, "

2700
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:38,000
what's the difference between 
a stalagmite and a stalactite?"

2701
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,880
"Stalagmite's got an 'm' in it,"

2702
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:40,920
said Hagrid.

2703
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:44,880
"An' don' ask me questions just 
now, I think I'm gonna be sick."

2704
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:46,400
He did look very green,

2705
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,360
and when the cart stopped at last 
beside a small door in the passage wall,

2706
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:54,600
Hagrid got out and had to lean against 
the wall to stop his knees from trembling.

2707
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,320
Griphook unlocked the door.

2708
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,560
A lot of green smoke came billowing out,

2709
01:39:58,560 --> 01:39:59,680
and as it cleared,

2710
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:00,920
Harry gasped.

2711
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:03,000
Inside were mounds of gold coins.

2712
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,320
Columns of silver.

2713
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:06,080
Heaps of little bronze Knuts.

2714
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:06,840
"All yours,"

2715
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:08,000
smiled Hagrid.

2716
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:08,880
All Harry's ,

2717
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,160
it was incredible.

2718
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,760
The Dursleys couldn't have known about this

2719
01:40:12,760 --> 01:40:15,360
or they'd have had it from 
him faster than blinking.

2720
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:18,320
How often had they complained 
how much Harry cost them to keep?

2721
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:21,480
And all the time there had been 
a small fortune belonging to him,

2722
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:22,960
buried deep under London.

2723
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:25,880
Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.

2724
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:27,280
"The gold ones are Galleons,"

2725
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,480
he explained.

2726
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:32,840
"Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon 
and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle,

2727
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:34,200
it's easy enough.

2728
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,000
Right, that should be enough 
fer a couple o' terms,

2729
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,680
we'll keep the rest safe for yeh."

2730
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:40,160
He turned to Griphook.

2731
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:42,320
"Vault seven hundred and thirteen now,

2732
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,520
please, and can we go more slowly?"

2733
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:45,560
"One speed only,"

2734
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:46,680
said Griphook.

2735
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:49,600
They were going even deeper 
now and gathering speed.

2736
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,240
The air became colder and colder as 
they hurtled round tight corners.

2737
01:40:53,760 --> 01:40:56,280
They went rattling over an underground ravine,

2738
01:40:56,280 --> 01:41:00,120
and Harry leaned over the side to try 
to see what was down at the dark bottom,

2739
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,600
but Hagrid groaned and pulled him 
back by the scruff of his neck.

2740
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,640
Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.

2741
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:07,600
"Stand back,"

2742
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:09,280
said Griphook importantly.

2743
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:14,200
He stroked the door gently with one of his 
long fingers and it simply melted away.

2744
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:16,760
"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that,

2745
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:19,560
they'd be sucked through the 
door and trapped in there,"

2746
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:20,680
said Griphook.

2747
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:23,320
"How often do you check to 
see if anyone's inside?"

2748
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:24,360
Harry asked.

2749
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:25,800
"About once every ten years,"

2750
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:28,200
said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.

2751
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:31,840
Something really extraordinary had 
to be inside this top security vault,

2752
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:32,920
Harry was sure,

2753
01:41:32,920 --> 01:41:34,760
and he leaned forward eagerly,

2754
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:37,800
expecting to see fabulous 
jewels at the very least ,

2755
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,880
but at first he thought it was empty.

2756
01:41:39,880 --> 01:41:44,320
Then he noticed a grubby little package 
wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor.

2757
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,400
Hagrid picked it up and tucked 
it deep inside his coat.

2758
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:49,000
Harry longed to know what it was,

2759
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,680
but knew better than to ask.

2760
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,920
"Come on, back in this infernal cart,

2761
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:54,800
and don't talk to me on the way back,

2762
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,640
it's best if I keep me mouth shut,"

2763
01:41:56,640 --> 01:41:57,680
said Hagrid.

2764
01:41:57,680 --> 01:42:02,240
One wild cart ride later they stood 
blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts.

2765
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,960
Harry didn't know where to run first 
now that he had a bag full of money.

2766
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:06,880
He didn't have to know

2767
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:09,040
how many Galleons there were to a pound to know

2768
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,880
that he was holding more money than he'd had

2769
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:11,960
in his whole life ,

2770
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:14,400
more money than even Dudley had ever had.

2771
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:15,840
"Might as well get yer uniform,"

2772
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:20,000
said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam 
Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.

2773
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,320
"Listen, Harry,

2774
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:24,600
would yeh mind if I slipped off fer 
a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron?

2775
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:26,520
I hate them Gringotts carts."

2776
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,760
He did still look a bit sick,

2777
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:31,160
so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone,

2778
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,360
feeling nervous.

2779
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:36,160
Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling 
witch dressed all in mauve.

2780
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:37,640
"Hogwarts, clear?"

2781
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:40,120
she said, when Harry started to speak.

2782
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,680
"Got the lot here ,

2783
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:44,400
another young man being 
fitted up just now, in fact.

2784
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:44,800
"

2785
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:46,080
In the back of the shop,

2786
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:47,200
a boy with a pale,

2787
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:48,320
pointed face was standing

2788
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:52,520
on a footstool while a second witch 
pinned up his long black robes.

2789
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:57,280
Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next 
to him) slipped a long robe over his head,

2790
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,480
and began to pin it to the right length.

2791
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:00,040
"Hello,"

2792
01:43:00,040 --> 01:43:00,880
said the boy,

2793
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,440
"Hogwarts, too?"

2794
01:43:02,440 --> 01:43:02,800
"Yes,"

2795
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:03,800
said Harry.

2796
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:07,720
"My father's next door buying my books and 
mother's up the street looking at wands,"

2797
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:11,080
said the boy. He had a bored, drawling voice.

2798
01:43:11,080 --> 01:43:14,000
"Then I'm going to drag them 
off to took at racing brooms.

2799
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,760
I don't see why first years can't have their own.

2800
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:20,440
I think I'll bully father into getting 
me one and I'll smuggle it in somehow."

2801
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:22,800
Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.

2802
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,120
"Have you got your own broom?"

2803
01:43:24,120 --> 01:43:25,400
the boy went on.

2804
01:43:25,400 --> 01:43:25,680
"No,"

2805
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:26,600
said Harry.

2806
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:28,080
"Play Quidditch at all?"

2807
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:28,680
"No,"

2808
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:31,840
Harry said again, wondering what 
on earth Quidditch could be.

2809
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,200
"I do , Father says it's a crime if 
I'm not picked to play for my house,

2810
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,200
and I must say, I agree.

2811
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:38,960
Know what house you'll be in yet?"

2812
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:39,600
"No,"

2813
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,520
said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute.

2814
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,880
"Well, no one really knows until they get there,

2815
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,720
do they, but I know I'll be in Slytherin,

2816
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:49,280
all our family have been ,

2817
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,160
imagine being in Hufflepuff,

2818
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,320
I think I'd leave,

2819
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,200
wouldn't you?"

2820
01:43:53,200 --> 01:43:53,920
"Mmm,"

2821
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:57,200
said Harry, wishing he could say 
something a bit more interesting.

2822
01:43:57,200 --> 01:43:58,920
"I say, look at that man!"

2823
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:00,080
said the boy suddenly,

2824
01:44:00,080 --> 01:44:01,800
nodding toward the front window.

2825
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:03,200
Hagrid was standing there,

2826
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:07,560
grinning at Harry and pointing at two large 
ice creams to show he couldn't come in.

2827
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:08,400
"That's Hagrid,"

2828
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:11,280
said Harry, pleased to know 
something the boy didn't.

2829
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,120
"He works at Hogwarts."

2830
01:44:13,120 --> 01:44:13,440
"Oh,"

2831
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:14,200
said the boy,

2832
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:17,360
"I've heard of him. He's a 
sort of servant, isn't he?"

2833
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,360
"He's the gamekeeper,"

2834
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:22,840
said Harry. He was liking the 
boy less and less every second.

2835
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,440
"Yes, exactly.

2836
01:44:24,440 --> 01:44:26,040
I heard he's a sort of savage ,

2837
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:30,160
lives in a hut on the school grounds 
and every now and then he gets drunk,

2838
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:31,440
tries to do magic,

2839
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:34,280
and ends up setting fire to his bed."

2840
01:44:34,280 --> 01:44:35,400
"I think he's brilliant,"

2841
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:36,800
said Harry coldly.

2842
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:37,560
"Do you?"

2843
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:39,840
said the boy, with a slight sneer.

2844
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,280
"Why is he with you? Where are your parents?"

2845
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:43,040
"They're dead,"

2846
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:44,400
said Harry shortly.

2847
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,440
He didn't feel much like going 
into the matter with this boy.

2848
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,400
"Oh, sorry,"

2849
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,920
said the other,. not sounding sorry at all.

2850
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:53,160
"But they were our kind, weren't they?"

2851
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:55,920
"They were a witch and wizard, 
if that's what you mean."

2852
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:58,840
"I really don't think they should 
let the other sort in, do you?

2853
01:44:58,840 --> 01:45:00,200
They're just not the same,

2854
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:02,560
they've never been brought up to know our ways.

2855
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:07,040
Some of them have never even heard of 
Hogwarts until they get the letter, imagine.

2856
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,800
I think they should keep it 
in the old wizarding families.

2857
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:10,880
What's your surname,

2858
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:11,680
anyway?"

2859
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,320
But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said,

2860
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,040
"That's you done, my dear,"

2861
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:19,840
and Harry, not sorry for an 
excuse to stop talking to the boy,

2862
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,600
hopped down from the footstool.

2863
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,240
"Well, I'll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,"

2864
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:25,640
said the drawling boy.

2865
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:29,600
Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice 
cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate

2866
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,720
and raspberry with chopped nuts).

2867
01:45:31,720 --> 01:45:32,480
"What's up?"

2868
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:33,640
said Hagrid.

2869
01:45:33,640 --> 01:45:34,160
"Nothing,"

2870
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:35,240
Harry lied.

2871
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:37,520
They stopped to buy parchment and quills.

2872
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:41,840
Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle 
of ink that changed color as you wrote.

2873
01:45:41,840 --> 01:45:43,120
When they had left the shop,

2874
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:45,080
he said, "Hagrid, what's Quidditch?"

2875
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,000
"Blimey, Harry,

2876
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,240
I keep forgettin' how little yeh know ,

2877
01:45:49,240 --> 01:45:50,440
not knowin' about Quidditch!"

2878
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:52,360
"Don't make me feel worse,"

2879
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:55,920
said Harry. He told Hagrid about 
the pate boy in Madam Malkin's.

2880
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,840
", and he said people from Muggle 
families shouldn't even be allowed in."

2881
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,640
"Yer not from a Muggle family.

2882
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:03,000
If he'd known who yeh were ,

2883
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:06,720
he's grown up knowin' yer name if 
his parents are wizardin' folk.

2884
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:10,320
You saw what everyone in the Leaky 
Cauldron was like when they saw yeh.

2885
01:46:10,320 --> 01:46:12,280
Anyway, what does he know about it,

2886
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:15,320
some o' the best I ever saw 
were the only ones with magic

2887
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:17,640
in 'em in a long line 0' Muggles ,

2888
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:18,720
look at yer mum!

2889
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:20,480
Look what she had fer a sister!"

2890
01:46:20,480 --> 01:46:21,320
"So what is Quidditch?"

2891
01:46:21,320 --> 01:46:23,000
"It's our sport.

2892
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:24,240
Wizard sport.

2893
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:24,800
It's like ,

2894
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,680
like soccer in the Muggle world ,

2895
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:28,140
everyone follows Quidditch ,

2896
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:31,040
played up in the air on broomsticks 
and there's four balls ,

2897
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,360
sorta hard ter explain the rules."

2898
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:35,520
"And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?"

2899
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,720
"School houses.

2900
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:37,800
There's four.

2901
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:41,400
Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o' duffers,

2902
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:42,400
but , "

2903
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:43,760
"I bet I'm in Hufflepuff"

2904
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:45,120
said Harry gloomily.

2905
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:46,880
"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,"

2906
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,240
said Hagrid darkly.

2907
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:51,960
"There's not a single witch or wizard 
who went bad who wasn't in Slytherin.

2908
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,200
You-Know-Who was one."

2909
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:56,680
"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?"

2910
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:57,600
"Years an' years ago,"

2911
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,600
said Hagrid.

2912
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:01,680
They bought Harry's school books in 
a shop called Flourish and Blotts

2913
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:05,480
where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling 
with books as large as paving stones bound

2914
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:06,400
in leather;

2915
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:09,560
books the size of postage 
stamps in covers of silk;

2916
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:13,520
books full of peculiar symbols and a 
few books with nothing in them at all.

2917
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:14,240
Even Dudley,

2918
01:47:14,240 --> 01:47:15,600
who never read anything,

2919
01:47:15,600 --> 01:47:18,280
would have been wild to get 
his hands on some of these.

2920
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,840
Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses

2921
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:23,160
and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends

2922
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:26,720
and Befuddle Your Enemies with 
the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss,

2923
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:27,680
Jelly-Legs,

2924
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:29,080
Tongue- Tying and Much,

2925
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:32,000
Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.

2926
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,440
"I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley."

2927
01:47:34,440 --> 01:47:36,720
"I'm not sayin' that's not a good idea,

2928
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:41,600
but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle 
world except in very special circumstances,"

2929
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,600
said Hagrid.

2930
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:43,040
"An' anyway,

2931
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,880
yeh couldn' work any of them curses yet,

2932
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:49,160
yeh'll need a lot more study 
before yeh get ter that level."

2933
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:52,480
Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy 
a solid gold cauldron, either (

2934
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:53,900
"It says pewter on yer list"

2935
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:57,320
), but they got a nice set of scales 
for weighing potion ingredients

2936
01:47:57,320 --> 01:47:59,680
and a collapsible brass telescope.

2937
01:47:59,680 --> 01:48:01,520
Then they visited the Apothecary,

2938
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:04,720
which was fascinating enough to 
make up for its horrible smell,

2939
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:07,560
a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages.

2940
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:09,920
Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor;

2941
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,000
jars of herbs,

2942
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,000
dried roots,

2943
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:13,920
and bright powders lined the walls;

2944
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,120
bundles of feathers,

2945
01:48:15,120 --> 01:48:16,360
strings of fangs,

2946
01:48:16,360 --> 01:48:18,680
and snarled claws hung from the ceiling.

2947
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:21,440
While Hagrid asked the man 
behind the counter for a supply

2948
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:24,120
of some basic potion ingredients for Harry,

2949
01:48:24,120 --> 01:48:29,240
Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns 
at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule,

2950
01:48:29,240 --> 01:48:32,480
glittery-black beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).

2951
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:35,680
Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid 
checked Harry's list again.

2952
01:48:35,680 --> 01:48:37,560
"Just yer wand left - A yeah,

2953
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:40,800
an' I still haven't got yeh a birthday present."

2954
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,640
Harry felt himself go red.

2955
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:43,840
"You don't have to , "

2956
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,320
"I know I don't have to.

2957
01:48:45,320 --> 01:48:46,200
Tell yeh what,

2958
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,440
I'll get yer animal.

2959
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:48,760
Not a toad,

2960
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,840
toads went outta fashion years ago,

2961
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:54,160
yeh'd be laughed at - an' I don' like cats,

2962
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:55,520
they make me sneeze.

2963
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:56,720
I'll get yer an owl.

2964
01:48:56,720 --> 01:48:57,960
All the kids want owls,

2965
01:48:57,960 --> 01:48:59,000
they're dead useful,

2966
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:00,280
carry yer mail an' everythin'."

2967
01:49:00,280 --> 01:49:02,600
Twenty minutes later,

2968
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,520
they left Eeylops Owl Emporium,

2969
01:49:04,520 --> 01:49:07,280
which had been dark and full 
of rustling and flickering,

2970
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,760
jewel-bright eyes.

2971
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:12,320
Harry now carried a large cage 
that held a beautiful snowy owl,

2972
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,560
fast asleep with her head under her wing.

2973
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:16,520
He couldn't stop stammering his thanks,

2974
01:49:16,520 --> 01:49:18,340
sounding just like Professor Quirrell.

2975
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:19,680
"Don' mention it,"

2976
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,160
said Hagrid gruffly.

2977
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:24,320
"Don' expect you've had a lotta 
presents from them Dursleys.

2978
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:27,600
Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands,

2979
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:28,520
Ollivanders,

2980
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,520
and yeh gotta have the best wand."

2981
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:31,720
A magic wand...

2982
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:34,520
this was what Harry had been 
really looking forward to.

2983
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:36,960
The last shop was narrow and shabby.

2984
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:43,040
Peeling gold letters over the door read 
Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C.

2985
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:47,360
A single wand lay on a faded 
purple cushion in the dusty window.

2986
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:51,840
A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the 
depths of the shop as they stepped inside.

2987
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:53,080
It was a tiny place,

2988
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:54,640
empty except for a single,

2989
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,200
spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait.

2990
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:00,760
Harry felt strangely as though he 
had entered a very strict library;

2991
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:03,800
he swallowed a lot of new questions 
that had just occurred to him

2992
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:08,520
and looked instead at the thousands of narrow 
boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.

2993
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:09,480
For some reason,

2994
01:50:09,480 --> 01:50:11,120
the back of his neck prickled.

2995
01:50:11,120 --> 01:50:15,120
The very dust and silence in here 
seemed to tingle with some secret magic.

2996
01:50:15,120 --> 01:50:16,040
"Good afternoon,"

2997
01:50:16,040 --> 01:50:17,480
said a soft voice.

2998
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:18,520
Harry jumped.

2999
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:19,680
Hagrid must have jumped,

3000
01:50:19,680 --> 01:50:24,520
too, because there was a loud crunching noise 
and he got quickly off the spindly chair.

3001
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,440
An old man was standing before them,

3002
01:50:26,440 --> 01:50:30,320
his wide, pale eyes shining like 
moons through the gloom of the shop.

3003
01:50:30,320 --> 01:50:30,840
"Hello,"

3004
01:50:30,840 --> 01:50:32,360
said Harry awkwardly.

3005
01:50:32,360 --> 01:50:33,040
"Ah yes,"

3006
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:34,240
said the man.

3007
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:38,680
"Yes, yes. I thought I'd be 
seeing you soon. Harry Potter."

3008
01:50:38,680 --> 01:50:39,920
It wasn't a question.

3009
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:41,440
"You have your mother's eyes.

3010
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:44,120
It seems only yesterday she was in here herself,

3011
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:45,680
buying her first wand.

3012
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:47,520
Ten and a quarter inches long,

3013
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,480
swishy, made of willow.

3014
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:51,120
Nice wand for charm work."

3015
01:50:51,120 --> 01:50:53,720
Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry.

3016
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:55,400
Harry wished he would blink.

3017
01:50:55,400 --> 01:50:57,600
Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.

3018
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,360
"Your father,

3019
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,480
on the other hand,

3020
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,160
favored a mahogany wand.

3021
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:03,280
Eleven inches. Pliable.

3022
01:51:03,280 --> 01:51:06,520
A little more power and 
excellent for transfiguration.

3023
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:08,760
Well, I say your father favored it ,

3024
01:51:08,760 --> 01:51:10,920
it's really the wand that chooses the wizard,

3025
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:11,920
of course."

3026
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:16,640
Mr. Ollivander had come so close that 
he and Harry were almost nose to nose.

3027
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:19,760
Harry could see himself 
reflected in those misty eyes.

3028
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:21,200
"And that's where..."

3029
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:25,680
Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning 
scar on Harry's forehead with a long,

3030
01:51:25,680 --> 01:51:26,760
white finger.

3031
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:28,880
"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,"

3032
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,160
he said softly.

3033
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:33,560
"Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew.

3034
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:34,680
Powerful wand,

3035
01:51:34,680 --> 01:51:35,680
very powerful,

3036
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:37,280
and in the wrong hands...

3037
01:51:37,280 --> 01:51:40,720
well, if I'd known what that wand was 
going out into the world to do...."

3038
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:45,160
He shook his head and then, to Harry's 
relief, spotted Hagrid. "Rubeus!

3039
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:46,400
Rubeus Hagrid!

3040
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:47,840
How nice to see you again....

3041
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:50,040
Oak, sixteen inches,

3042
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:50,960
rather bendy,

3043
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:51,760
wasn't it?"

3044
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,280
"It was, sir, yes,"

3045
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:54,280
said Hagrid.

3046
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:55,600
"Good wand, that one.

3047
01:51:55,600 --> 01:51:58,720
But I suppose they snapped it 
in half when you got expelled?"

3048
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:01,400
said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.

3049
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,880
"Er , yes, they did, yes,"

3050
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:06,040
said Hagrid, shuffling his feet.

3051
01:52:06,040 --> 01:52:07,520
"I've still got the pieces, though,"

3052
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,680
he added brightly.

3053
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:09,880
"But you don't use them?"

3054
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:12,040
said Mr. Ollivander sharply.

3055
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:13,200
"Oh, no, sit,"

3056
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:14,560
said Hagrid quickly.

3057
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:18,920
Harry noticed he gripped his pink 
umbrella very tightly as he spoke.

3058
01:52:18,920 --> 01:52:19,560
"Hmmm,"

3059
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:22,960
said Mr. Ollivander, giving 
Hagrid a piercing look.

3060
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:26,320
"Well, now , Mr. Potter. Let me see."

3061
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:30,000
He pulled a long tape measure with 
silver markings out of his pocket.

3062
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,280
"Which is your wand arm?"

3063
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,120
"Er , well, I'm right-handed,"

3064
01:52:33,120 --> 01:52:34,120
said Harry.

3065
01:52:34,120 --> 01:52:36,040
"Hold out your arm. That's it."

3066
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,840
He measured Harry from shoulder to finger,

3067
01:52:38,840 --> 01:52:40,000
then wrist to elbow,

3068
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,280
shoulder to floor,

3069
01:52:41,280 --> 01:52:43,480
knee to armpit and round his head.

3070
01:52:43,480 --> 01:52:44,240
As he measured,

3071
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:48,480
he said, "Every Ollivander wand has a 
core of a powerful magical substance,

3072
01:52:48,480 --> 01:52:49,640
Mr. Potter.

3073
01:52:49,640 --> 01:52:51,040
We use unicorn hairs,

3074
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:52,480
phoenix tail feathers,

3075
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,360
and the heartstrings of dragons.

3076
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:56,480
No two Ollivander wands are the same,

3077
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,200
just as no two unicorns,

3078
01:52:58,200 --> 01:53:01,040
dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same.

3079
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:01,880
And of course,

3080
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:05,120
you will never get such good 
results with another wizard's wand."

3081
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:07,640
Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure,

3082
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:09,840
which was measuring between his nostrils,

3083
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:11,440
was doing this on its own.

3084
01:53:11,440 --> 01:53:13,920
Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves,

3085
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,560
taking down boxes.

3086
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:16,200
"That will do,"

3087
01:53:16,200 --> 01:53:19,800
he said, and the tape measure 
crumpled into a heap on the floor.

3088
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:20,440
"Right then,

3089
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:21,600
Mr. Potter.

3090
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:22,640
Try this one.

3091
01:53:22,640 --> 01:53:24,640
Beechwood and dragon heartstring.

3092
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:25,880
Nine inches.

3093
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:27,280
Nice and flexible.

3094
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:29,200
just take it and give it a wave."

3095
01:53:29,200 --> 01:53:32,800
Harry took the wand and (feeling 
foolish) waved it around a bit,

3096
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,360
but Mr. Ollivander snatched it 
out of his hand almost at once.

3097
01:53:36,360 --> 01:53:41,440
"Maple and phoenix feather. Seven 
inches. Quite whippy. Try , "

3098
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,440
Harry tried ,

3099
01:53:42,440 --> 01:53:44,360
but he had hardly raised the wand when it,

3100
01:53:44,360 --> 01:53:47,800
too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.

3101
01:53:47,800 --> 01:53:49,520
"No, no -here,

3102
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:51,360
ebony and unicorn hair,

3103
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,880
eight and a half inches, springy.

3104
01:53:53,880 --> 01:53:55,280
Go on, go on,

3105
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:56,240
try it out."

3106
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:58,320
Harry tried. And tried.

3107
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:02,280
He had no idea what Mr. 
Ollivander was waiting for.

3108
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:06,360
The pile of tried wands was mounting 
higher and higher on the spindly chair,

3109
01:54:06,360 --> 01:54:09,440
but the more wands Mr. Ollivander 
pulled from the shelves,

3110
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,320
the happier he seemed to become.

3111
01:54:11,320 --> 01:54:13,160
"Tricky customer, eh?

3112
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:14,000
Not to worry,

3113
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,160
we'll find the perfect match here somewhere ,

3114
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:18,280
I wonder, now - - yes,

3115
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:20,640
why not , unusual combination ,

3116
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:22,400
holly and phoenix feather,

3117
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:23,240
eleven inches,

3118
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:24,520
nice and supple."

3119
01:54:24,520 --> 01:54:25,840
Harry took the wand.

3120
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,120
He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers.

3121
01:54:28,120 --> 01:54:29,880
He raised the wand above his head,

3122
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:32,040
brought it swishing down through the dusty air

3123
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:35,840
and a stream of red and gold sparks 
shot from the end like a firework,

3124
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:38,600
throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls.

3125
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:41,760
Hagrid whooped and clapped 
and Mr. Ollivander cried,

3126
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,080
"Oh, bravo!

3127
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:44,600
Yes, indeed,

3128
01:54:44,600 --> 01:54:46,200
oh, very good.

3129
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:48,120
Well, well, well...

3130
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:49,080
how curious...

3131
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:50,240
how very curious...

3132
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:50,920
"

3133
01:54:50,920 --> 01:54:54,680
He put Harry's wand back into its 
box and wrapped it in brown paper,

3134
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,560
still muttering,

3135
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:57,680
"Curious... curious..

3136
01:54:57,680 --> 01:54:58,200
"Sorry,"

3137
01:54:58,200 --> 01:54:59,080
said Harry,

3138
01:54:59,080 --> 01:55:00,480
"but what's curious?"

3139
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:03,400
Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.

3140
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:05,240
"I remember every wand I've ever sold,

3141
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:06,440
Mr. Potter.

3142
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:07,880
Every single wand.

3143
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:11,560
It so happens that the phoenix 
whose tail feather is in your wand,

3144
01:55:11,560 --> 01:55:12,840
gave another feather ,

3145
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:13,920
just one other.

3146
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:18,640
It is very curious indeed that you should be 
destined for this wand when its brother why,

3147
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:20,480
its brother gave you that scar."

3148
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,880
Harry swallowed.

3149
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:24,960
"Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew.

3150
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:27,680
Curious indeed how these things happen.

3151
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:29,320
The wand chooses the wizard,

3152
01:55:29,320 --> 01:55:30,200
remember....

3153
01:55:30,200 --> 01:55:32,640
I think we must expect great things from you,

3154
01:55:32,640 --> 01:55:33,760
Mr. Potter....

3155
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,440
After all, He- Who-Must-Not-Be-Named 
did great things ,

3156
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:38,520
terrible, yes,

3157
01:55:38,520 --> 01:55:39,520
but great."

3158
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,640
Harry shivered.

3159
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:43,640
He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much.

3160
01:55:43,640 --> 01:55:46,000
He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand,

3161
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,560
and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.

3162
01:55:48,560 --> 01:55:51,160
The late afternoon sun hung 
low in the sky as Harry

3163
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:54,400
and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley,

3164
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:55,560
back through the wall,

3165
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:58,160
back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty.

3166
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:01,000
Harry didn't speak at all as 
they walked down the road;

3167
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:04,720
he didn't even notice how much people 
were gawking at them on the Underground,

3168
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:07,560
laden as they were with all 
their funny-shaped packages,

3169
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:10,680
with the snowy owl asleep 
in its cage on Harry's lap.

3170
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:11,840
Up another escalator,

3171
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,000
out into Paddington station;

3172
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,560
Harry only realized where they were 
when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.

3173
01:56:17,560 --> 01:56:20,880
"Got time fer a bite to eat 
before yer train leaves," he said.

3174
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:25,640
He bought Harry a hamburger and they 
sat down on plastic seats to eat them.

3175
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,280
Harry kept looking around.

3176
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,520
Everything looked so strange, somehow.

3177
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,240
"You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,"

3178
01:56:32,240 --> 01:56:33,240
said Hagrid.

3179
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:35,200
Harry wasn't sure he could explain.

3180
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:37,840
He'd just had the best birthday of his life ,

3181
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:39,800
and yet , he chewed his hamburger,

3182
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:41,600
trying to find the words.

3183
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,880
"Everyone thinks I'm special,"

3184
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,160
he said at last.

3185
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,160
"All those people in the Leaky Cauldron,

3186
01:56:46,160 --> 01:56:47,360
Professor Quirrell,

3187
01:56:47,360 --> 01:56:48,640
Mr. Ollivander...

3188
01:56:48,640 --> 01:56:51,320
but I don't know anything about magic at all.

3189
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:53,240
How can they expect great things?

3190
01:56:53,240 --> 01:56:56,440
I'm famous and I can't even 
remember what I'm famous for.

3191
01:56:56,440 --> 01:56:57,880
I don't know what happened when Vol-,

3192
01:56:58,920 --> 01:57:00,280
sorry , I mean,

3193
01:57:00,280 --> 01:57:01,920
the night my parents died."

3194
01:57:01,920 --> 01:57:03,800
Hagrid leaned across the table.

3195
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:07,800
Behind the wild beard and eyebrows 
he wore a very kind smile.

3196
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:09,560
"Don' you worry, Harry.

3197
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:11,120
You'll learn fast enough.

3198
01:57:11,120 --> 01:57:13,880
Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts,

3199
01:57:13,880 --> 01:57:15,200
you'll be just fine.

3200
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:16,520
just be yerself.

3201
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:17,720
I know it's hard.

3202
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:19,320
Yeh've been singled out,

3203
01:57:19,320 --> 01:57:20,840
an' that's always hard.

3204
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:23,080
But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts ,

3205
01:57:23,080 --> 01:57:24,360
I did , still do,

3206
01:57:24,360 --> 01:57:25,560
'smatter of fact."

3207
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:29,160
Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that 
would take him back to the Dursleys,

3208
01:57:29,160 --> 01:57:30,760
then handed him an envelope.

3209
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:32,920
"Yer ticket fer Hogwarts, " he said.

3210
01:57:32,920 --> 01:57:34,280
"First o' September ,

3211
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:35,320
King's Cross ,

3212
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:36,800
it's all on yer ticket.

3213
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,440
Any problems with the Dursleys,

3214
01:57:38,440 --> 01:57:39,960
send me a letter with yer owl,

3215
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:41,480
she'll know where to find me....

3216
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:42,680
See yeh soon,

3217
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:43,480
Harry."

3218
01:57:43,480 --> 01:57:45,440
The train pulled out of the station.

3219
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:48,360
Harry wanted to watch Hagrid 
until he was out of sight;

3220
01:57:48,360 --> 01:57:51,400
he rose in his seat and pressed 
his nose against the window,

3221
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,760
but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.

3222
01:57:53,760 --> 01:57:55,000
CHAPTER SIX

3223
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:57,840
THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS

3224
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:00,880
Harry's last month with the Dursleys wasn't fun.

3225
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:05,040
True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry 
he wouldn't stay in the same room,

3226
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:08,600
while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon 
didn't shut Harry in his cupboard,

3227
01:58:08,600 --> 01:58:10,200
force him to do anything,

3228
01:58:10,200 --> 01:58:11,220
or shout at him ,

3229
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:13,760
in fact, they didn't speak to him at all.

3230
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,920
Half terrified,

3231
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:15,840
half furious,

3232
01:58:15,840 --> 01:58:18,720
they acted as though any chair 
with Harry in it were empty.

3233
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:20,840
Although this was an improvement in many ways,

3234
01:58:20,840 --> 01:58:23,440
it did become a bit depressing after a while.

3235
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:24,640
Harry kept to his room,

3236
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:26,280
with his new owl for company.

3237
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:28,040
He had decided to call her Hedwig,

3238
01:58:28,040 --> 01:58:30,600
a name he had found in A History of Magic.

3239
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:32,720
His school books were very interesting.

3240
01:58:32,720 --> 01:58:35,040
He lay on his bed reading late into the night,

3241
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:38,600
Hedwig swooping in and out of 
the open window as she pleased.

3242
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:42,040
It was lucky that Aunt Petunia 
didn't come in to vacuum anymore,

3243
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:44,600
because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice.

3244
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:46,560
Every night before he went to sleep,

3245
01:58:46,560 --> 01:58:50,200
Harry ticked off another day on the 
piece of paper he had pinned to the wall,

3246
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,440
counting down to September the first.

3247
01:58:52,440 --> 01:58:55,480
On the last day of August he thought 
he'd better speak to his aunt

3248
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:58,600
and uncle about getting to King's 
Cross station the next day,

3249
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:02,520
so he went down to the living room where 
they were watching a quiz show on television.

3250
01:59:02,520 --> 01:59:04,960
He cleared his throat to 
let them know he was there,

3251
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:07,440
and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.

3252
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:09,160
"Er , Uncle Vernon?"

3253
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:11,600
Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.

3254
01:59:11,600 --> 01:59:15,400
"Er , I need to be at King's Cross 
tomorrow to , to go to Hogwarts."

3255
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:17,160
Uncle Vernon grunted again.

3256
01:59:17,160 --> 01:59:19,360
"Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?"

3257
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:22,160
Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.

3258
01:59:22,160 --> 01:59:22,880
"Thank you."

3259
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:26,600
He was about to go back upstairs 
when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.

3260
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:29,240
"Funny way to get to a wizards' school, the train.

3261
01:59:29,240 --> 01:59:31,120
Magic carpets all got punctures,

3262
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:31,880
have they?"

3263
01:59:31,880 --> 01:59:33,520
Harry didn't say anything.

3264
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:35,480
"Where is this school, anyway?"

3265
01:59:35,480 --> 01:59:36,160
"I don't know,"

3266
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:37,080
said Harry,

3267
01:59:37,080 --> 01:59:39,080
realizing this for the first time.

3268
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:42,200
He pulled the ticket Hagrid had 
given him out of his pocket.

3269
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:47,120
"I just take the train from platform nine and 
three-quarters at eleven o'clock," he read.

3270
01:59:47,120 --> 01:59:48,960
His aunt and uncle stared.

3271
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,160
"Platform what?"

3272
01:59:50,160 --> 01:59:52,040
"Nine and three-quarters."

3273
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:52,920
"Don't talk rubbish,"

3274
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,160
said Uncle Vernon.

3275
01:59:54,160 --> 01:59:56,840
"There is no platform nine and three-quarters."

3276
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:58,000
"It's on my ticket."

3277
01:59:58,000 --> 01:59:58,720
"Barking,"

3278
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,840
said Uncle Vernon,

3279
01:59:59,840 --> 02:00:00,800
"howling mad,

3280
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:01,840
the lot of them.

3281
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:02,800
You'll see.

3282
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,000
You just wait.

3283
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,360
All right, we'll take you to King's Cross.

3284
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:08,320
We're going up to London tomorrow anyway,

3285
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,680
or I wouldn't bother."

3286
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:11,160
"Why are you going to London?"

3287
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:13,800
Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.

3288
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,480
"Taking Dudley to the hospital,"

3289
02:00:15,480 --> 02:00:16,960
growled Uncle Vernon.

3290
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:20,360
"Got to have that ruddy tail removed 
before he goes to Smeltings."

3291
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:22,640
Harry woke at five o'clock the next morning

3292
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:25,680
and was too excited and 
nervous to go back to sleep.

3293
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:27,440
He got up and pulled on his jeans

3294
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:30,520
because he didn't want to walk into 
the station in his wizard's robes ,

3295
02:00:30,520 --> 02:00:32,200
he'd change on the train.

3296
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:36,080
He checked his Hogwarts list yet again 
to make sure he had everything he needed,

3297
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:38,720
saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage,

3298
02:00:38,720 --> 02:00:40,080
and then paced the room,

3299
02:00:40,080 --> 02:00:42,000
waiting for the Dursleys to get up.

3300
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,120
Two hours later,

3301
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,200
Harry's huge,

3302
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:47,000
heavy trunk had been loaded 
into the Dursleys' car,

3303
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:50,120
Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley 
into sitting next to Harry,

3304
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:51,440
and they had set off.

3305
02:00:51,440 --> 02:00:53,960
They reached King's Cross at half past ten.

3306
02:00:53,960 --> 02:00:58,680
Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto a 
cart and wheeled it into the station for him.

3307
02:00:58,680 --> 02:01:02,520
Harry thought this was strangely 
kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead,

3308
02:01:02,520 --> 02:01:05,880
facing the platforms with 
a nasty grin on his face.

3309
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:07,720
"Well, there you are, boy.

3310
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:08,920
Platform nine ,

3311
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:09,880
platform ten.

3312
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:12,000
Your platform should be somewhere in the middle,

3313
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:13,720
but they don't seem to have built it yet,

3314
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:14,520
do they?"

3315
02:01:14,520 --> 02:01:16,440
He was quite right, of course.

3316
02:01:16,440 --> 02:01:19,320
There was a big plastic 
number nine over one platform

3317
02:01:19,320 --> 02:01:22,320
and a big plastic number 
ten over the one next to it,

3318
02:01:22,320 --> 02:01:23,240
and in the middle,

3319
02:01:23,240 --> 02:01:24,360
nothing at all.

3320
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,400
"Have a good term,"

3321
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:28,160
said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier smile.

3322
02:01:28,160 --> 02:01:29,880
He left without another word.

3323
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:32,520
Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away.

3324
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:34,120
All three of them were laughing.

3325
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:35,920
Harry's mouth went rather dry.

3326
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:38,360
What on earth was he going to do?

3327
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:40,840
He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks,

3328
02:01:40,840 --> 02:01:41,960
because of Hedwig.

3329
02:01:41,960 --> 02:01:43,360
He'd have to ask someone.

3330
02:01:43,360 --> 02:01:45,040
He stopped a passing guard,

3331
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:48,200
but didn't dare mention platform 
nine and three-quarters.

3332
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:50,080
The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and

3333
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:53,440
when Harry couldn't even tell him 
what part of the country it was in,

3334
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:54,960
he started to get annoyed,

3335
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:57,440
as though Harry was being stupid on purpose.

3336
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:58,560
Getting desperate,

3337
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:01,480
Harry asked for the train 
that left at eleven o'clock,

3338
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:03,280
but the guard said there wasn't one.

3339
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:04,800
In the end the guard strode away,

3340
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,840
muttering about time wasters.

3341
02:02:06,840 --> 02:02:09,360
Harry was now trying hard not to panic.

3342
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,960
According to the large clock 
over the arrivals board,

3343
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:16,840
he had ten minutes left to get on the train 
to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it;

3344
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:20,720
he was stranded in the middle of a 
station with a trunk he could hardly lift,

3345
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:22,640
a pocket full of wizard money,

3346
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:23,920
and a large owl.

3347
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,960
Hagrid must have forgotten to 
tell him something you had to do,

3348
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:30,480
like tapping the third brick on 
the left to get into Diagon Alley.

3349
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,240
He wondered if he should get out his wand

3350
02:02:32,240 --> 02:02:36,720
and start tapping the ticket inspector's 
stand between platforms nine and ten.

3351
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:41,080
At that moment a group of people passed 
just behind him and he caught a few words of

3352
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:41,900
what they were saying.

3353
02:02:41,900 --> 02:02:45,000
", packed with Muggles, of course , "

3354
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:46,440
Harry swung round.

3355
02:02:46,440 --> 02:02:49,520
The speaker was a plump woman 
who was talking to four boys,

3356
02:02:49,520 --> 02:02:51,200
all with flaming red hair.

3357
02:02:51,200 --> 02:02:54,040
Each of them was pushing a trunk 
like Harry's in front of him ,

3358
02:02:54,040 --> 02:02:55,240
and they had an owl.

3359
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:56,120
Heart hammering,

3360
02:02:56,120 --> 02:02:58,000
Harry pushed his cart after them.

3361
02:02:58,000 --> 02:02:59,600
They stopped and so did he,

3362
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,960
just near enough to hear what they were saying.

3363
02:03:01,960 --> 02:03:03,920
"Now, what's the platform number?"

3364
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:05,360
said the boys' mother.

3365
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:06,920
"Nine and three-quarters!"

3366
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:10,960
piped a small girl, also red-headed, 
who was holding her hand,

3367
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,880
"Mom, can't I go... "

3368
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,080
"You're not old enough,

3369
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:16,000
Ginny, now be quiet.

3370
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,480
All right, Percy,

3371
02:03:17,480 --> 02:03:19,280
you go first."

3372
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:23,000
What looked like the oldest boy 
marched toward platforms nine and ten.

3373
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:24,000
Harry watched,

3374
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,280
careful not to blink in case he missed it ,

3375
02:03:26,280 --> 02:03:30,040
but just as the boy reached the dividing 
barrier between the two platforms,

3376
02:03:30,040 --> 02:03:33,040
a large crowd of tourists 
came swarming in front of him

3377
02:03:33,040 --> 02:03:35,760
and by the time the last 
backpack had cleared away,

3378
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:37,160
the boy had vanished.

3379
02:03:37,160 --> 02:03:38,520
"Fred, you next,"

3380
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:39,920
the plump woman said.

3381
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,560
"I'm not Fred, I'm George,"

3382
02:03:41,560 --> 02:03:42,520
said the boy.

3383
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:43,920
"Honestly, woman,

3384
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:46,160
you call yourself our mother?

3385
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:47,640
CarA you tell I'm George?"

3386
02:03:47,640 --> 02:03:49,560
"Sorry, George, dear."

3387
02:03:49,560 --> 02:03:51,480
"Only joking, I am Fred,"

3388
02:03:51,480 --> 02:03:52,480
said the boy,

3389
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,640
and off he went.

3390
02:03:53,640 --> 02:03:56,200
His twin called after him to hurry up,

3391
02:03:56,200 --> 02:03:57,640
and he must have done so,

3392
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:58,960
because a second later,

3393
02:03:58,960 --> 02:03:59,960
he had gone ,

3394
02:03:59,960 --> 02:04:01,320
but how had he done it?

3395
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:05,480
Now the third brother was walking briskly 
toward the barrier he was almost there ,

3396
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:06,920
and then, quite suddenly,

3397
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:08,320
he wasn't anywhere.

3398
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:09,960
There was nothing else for it.

3399
02:04:09,960 --> 02:04:10,600
"Excuse me,"

3400
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:12,280
Harry said to the plump woman.

3401
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:14,120
"Hello, dear," she said.

3402
02:04:14,120 --> 02:04:17,080
"First time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too."

3403
02:04:17,080 --> 02:04:19,960
She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons.

3404
02:04:19,960 --> 02:04:20,920
He was tall,

3405
02:04:20,920 --> 02:04:22,520
thin, and gangling,

3406
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:23,560
with freckles,

3407
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:24,840
big hands and feet,

3408
02:04:24,840 --> 02:04:26,360
and a long nose.

3409
02:04:26,360 --> 02:04:26,680
"Yes,"

3410
02:04:26,680 --> 02:04:27,720
said Harry.

3411
02:04:27,720 --> 02:04:30,160
"The thing is , the thing 
is, I don't know how to , "

3412
02:04:30,160 --> 02:04:31,800
"How to get onto the platform?"

3413
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:34,160
she said kindly, and Harry nodded.

3414
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:35,720
"Not to worry," she said.

3415
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:40,040
"All you have to do is walk straight at 
the barrier between platforms nine and ten.

3416
02:04:40,040 --> 02:04:42,920
Don't stop and don't be 
scared you'll crash into it,

3417
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:44,360
that's very important.

3418
02:04:44,360 --> 02:04:46,720
Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.

3419
02:04:46,720 --> 02:04:48,960
Go on, go now before Ron."

3420
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:50,040
"Er , okay,"

3421
02:04:50,040 --> 02:04:50,960
said Harry.

3422
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:53,960
He pushed his trolley around 
and stared at the barrier.

3423
02:04:53,960 --> 02:04:55,960
It looked very solid.

3424
02:04:55,960 --> 02:04:57,560
He started to walk toward it.

3425
02:04:57,560 --> 02:05:01,280
People jostled him on their 
way to platforms nine and ten.

3426
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,840
Harry walked more quickly.

3427
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:06,440
He was going to smash right into that 
barrier and then he'd be in trouble ,

3428
02:05:06,440 --> 02:05:08,200
leaning forward on his cart,

3429
02:05:08,200 --> 02:05:09,920
he broke into a heavy run ,

3430
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:12,200
the barrier was coming nearer and nearer ,

3431
02:05:12,200 --> 02:05:13,760
he wouldn't be able to stop ,

3432
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:15,400
the cart was out of control ,

3433
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:16,960
he was a foot away ,

3434
02:05:16,960 --> 02:05:19,320
he closed his eyes ready for the crash ,

3435
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:20,360
It didn't come...

3436
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:21,440
he kept on running...

3437
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:22,960
he opened his eyes.

3438
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:26,800
A scarlet steam engine was waiting 
next to a platform packed with people.

3439
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:29,200
A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express,

3440
02:05:29,200 --> 02:05:30,480
eleven O'clock.

3441
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:34,800
Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron 
archway where the barrier had been,

3442
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,720
with the words Platform Nine 
and Three-Quarters on it,

3443
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:38,760
He had done it.

3444
02:05:38,760 --> 02:05:42,160
Smoke from the engine drifted over 
the heads of the chattering crowd,

3445
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:45,720
while cats of every color wound 
here and there between their legs.

3446
02:05:45,720 --> 02:05:49,240
Owls hooted to one another in a 
disgruntled sort of way over the babble

3447
02:05:49,240 --> 02:05:51,240
and the scraping of heavy trunks.

3448
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:54,280
The first few carriages were 
already packed with students,

3449
02:05:54,280 --> 02:05:56,960
some hanging out of the window 
to talk to their families,

3450
02:05:56,960 --> 02:05:58,680
some fighting over seats.

3451
02:05:58,680 --> 02:06:02,400
Harry pushed his cart off down the 
platform in search of an empty seat.

3452
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,440
He passed a round-faced boy who was saying,

3453
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:06,880
"Gran, I've lost my toad again."

3454
02:06:06,880 --> 02:06:07,840
"Oh, Neville,"

3455
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:09,560
he heard the old woman sigh.

3456
02:06:09,560 --> 02:06:12,840
A boy with dreadlocks was 
surrounded by a small crowd.

3457
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:15,520
"Give us a look, Lee, go on."

3458
02:06:15,520 --> 02:06:17,720
The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms,

3459
02:06:17,720 --> 02:06:23,360
and the people around him shrieked and yelled 
as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.

3460
02:06:23,360 --> 02:06:27,000
Harry pressed on through the crowd until 
he found an empty compartment near the end

3461
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:28,000
of the train.

3462
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,840
He put Hedwig inside first

3463
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:33,360
and then started to shove and heave 
his trunk toward the train door.

3464
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:36,320
He tried to lift it up the steps 
but could hardly raise one end

3465
02:06:36,320 --> 02:06:39,520
and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.

3466
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:40,600
"Want a hand?"

3467
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:44,560
It was one of the red-haired twins 
he'd followed through the barrier.

3468
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:45,800
"Yes, please,"

3469
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:46,960
Harry panted.

3470
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:49,400
"Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!"

3471
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:50,440
With the twins' help,

3472
02:06:50,440 --> 02:06:54,800
Harry's trunk was at last tucked 
away in a corner of the compartment.

3473
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:55,280
"Thanks,"

3474
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:58,280
said Harry, pushing his 
sweaty hair out of his eyes.

3475
02:06:58,280 --> 02:06:59,040
"What's that?"

3476
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:02,600
said one of the twins suddenly, 
pointing at Harry's lightning scar.

3477
02:07:02,600 --> 02:07:03,280
"Blimey,"

3478
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,400
said the other twin. "Are you

3479
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:06,120
"He is,"

3480
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:07,560
said the first twin.

3481
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:08,200
"Aren't you?"

3482
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:09,520
he added to Harry.

3483
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:09,720
"What?"

3484
02:07:09,720 --> 02:07:10,800
said Harry.

3485
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:11,640
"Harry Potter, "

3486
02:07:11,640 --> 02:07:13,160
chorused the twins.

3487
02:07:13,160 --> 02:07:14,000
"Oh, him,"

3488
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:15,080
said Harry.

3489
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:17,120
"I mean, yes, I am."

3490
02:07:17,120 --> 02:07:18,600
The two boys gawked at him,

3491
02:07:18,600 --> 02:07:20,920
and Harry felt himself turning red.

3492
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:22,680
Then, to his relief,

3493
02:07:22,680 --> 02:07:25,600
a voice came floating in 
through the train's open door.

3494
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:28,240
"Fred? George? Are you there?"

3495
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:29,600
"Coming, Mom."

3496
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:32,720
With a last look at Harry, the 
twins hopped off the train.

3497
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:35,080
Harry sat down next to the window where,

3498
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:35,840
half hidden,

3499
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:39,880
he could watch the red-haired family on the 
platform and hear what they were saying.

3500
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:42,240
Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.

3501
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:44,640
"Ron, you've got something on your nose."

3502
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:46,920
The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way,

3503
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:50,560
but she grabbed him and began 
rubbing the end of his nose.

3504
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:51,560
"Mom , geroff"

3505
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:52,960
He wriggled free.

3506
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:55,760
"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie 
got somefink on his nosie?"

3507
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:57,160
said one of the twins.

3508
02:07:57,160 --> 02:07:58,760
"Shut up," said Ron.

3509
02:07:58,760 --> 02:07:59,760
"Where's Percy?"

3510
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:00,880
said their mother.

3511
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:02,040
"He's coming now."

3512
02:08:02,040 --> 02:08:04,560
The oldest boy came striding into sight.

3513
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:07,920
He had already changed into his 
billowing black Hogwarts robes,

3514
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:11,920
and Harry noticed a shiny silver badge 
on his chest with the letter P on it.

3515
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:13,960
"Can't stay long, Mother," he said.

3516
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:14,840
"I'm up front,

3517
02:08:14,840 --> 02:08:18,359
the prefects have got two 
compartments to themselves ,

3518
02:08:18,359 --> 02:08:18,360
"

3519
02:08:18,360 --> 02:08:20,880
"Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?"

3520
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:23,840
said one of the twins, with 
an air of great surprise.

3521
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:26,680
"You should have said something, we had no idea."

3522
02:08:26,680 --> 02:08:29,720
"Hang on, I think I remember 
him saying something about it,"

3523
02:08:29,720 --> 02:08:31,080
said the other twin.

3524
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:32,200
"Once , "

3525
02:08:32,200 --> 02:08:33,680
"Or twice , "

3526
02:08:33,680 --> 02:08:35,000
"A minute , "

3527
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,520
"All summer , "

3528
02:08:36,520 --> 02:08:37,880
"Oh, shut up,"

3529
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:39,600
said Percy the Prefect.

3530
02:08:39,600 --> 02:08:42,120
"How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?"

3531
02:08:42,120 --> 02:08:43,600
said one of the twins.

3532
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:44,720
"Because he's a prefect,"

3533
02:08:44,720 --> 02:08:46,280
said their mother fondly.

3534
02:08:46,280 --> 02:08:46,800
"All right,

3535
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:47,960
dear, well,

3536
02:08:47,960 --> 02:08:48,840
have a good term ,

3537
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:50,720
send me an owl when you get there."

3538
02:08:50,720 --> 02:08:53,240
She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left.

3539
02:08:53,240 --> 02:08:55,120
Then she turned to the twins.

3540
02:08:55,120 --> 02:08:56,360
"Now, you two ,

3541
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:58,440
this year, you behave yourselves.

3542
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,840
If I get one more owl telling me you've ,

3543
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:02,359
you've blown up a toilet or ,

3544
02:09:02,359 --> 02:09:02,360
"

3545
02:09:02,360 --> 02:09:05,640
"Blown up a toilet? We've 
never blown up a toilet."

3546
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:08,040
"Great idea though, thanks, Mom."

3547
02:09:08,040 --> 02:09:10,440
"It's not funny. And look after Ron."

3548
02:09:10,440 --> 02:09:13,320
"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us."

3549
02:09:13,320 --> 02:09:14,080
"Shut up,"

3550
02:09:14,080 --> 02:09:15,280
said Ron again.

3551
02:09:15,280 --> 02:09:18,880
He was almost as tall as the twins 
already and his nose was still pink

3552
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:20,600
where his mother had rubbed it.

3553
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:24,480
"Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess 
who we just met on the train?"

3554
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:27,280
Harry leaned back quickly so 
they couldn't see him looking.

3555
02:09:27,280 --> 02:09:30,160
"You know that black-haired boy 
who was near us in the station?

3556
02:09:30,160 --> 02:09:31,480
Know who he is?"

3557
02:09:31,480 --> 02:09:32,120
"Who?"

3558
02:09:32,120 --> 02:09:33,240
"Harry Potter!"

3559
02:09:33,240 --> 02:09:35,480
Harry heard the little girl's voice.

3560
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:40,280
"Oh, Mom, can I go on the train 
and see him, Mom, eh please...."

3561
02:09:40,280 --> 02:09:41,600
"You've already seen him,

3562
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:45,160
Ginny, and the poor boy isn't 
something you goggle at in a zoo.

3563
02:09:45,160 --> 02:09:46,880
Is he really, Fred?

3564
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:47,960
How do you know?"

3565
02:09:47,960 --> 02:09:51,320
"Asked him. Saw his scar. It's 
really there - like lightning."

3566
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:54,240
"Poor dear - no wonder he was alone,

3567
02:09:54,240 --> 02:09:55,120
I wondered.

3568
02:09:55,120 --> 02:09:58,880
He was ever so polite when he asked 
how to get onto the platform."

3569
02:09:58,880 --> 02:09:59,840
"Never mind that,

3570
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:02,960
do you think he remembers 
what You-Know-Who looks like?"

3571
02:10:02,960 --> 02:10:05,360
Their mother suddenly became very stern.

3572
02:10:05,360 --> 02:10:07,280
"I forbid you to ask him, Fred.

3573
02:10:07,280 --> 02:10:09,080
No, don't you dare.

3574
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:12,200
As though he needs reminding of 
that on his first day at school."

3575
02:10:12,200 --> 02:10:13,960
"All right, keep your hair on."

3576
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:15,280
A whistle sounded.

3577
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:16,080
"Hurry up!"

3578
02:10:16,080 --> 02:10:17,080
their mother said,

3579
02:10:17,080 --> 02:10:19,560
and the three boys clambered onto the train.

3580
02:10:19,560 --> 02:10:22,280
They leaned out of the window 
for her to kiss them good-bye,

3581
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:24,560
and their younger sister began to cry.

3582
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:27,360
"Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads of owls."

3583
02:10:27,360 --> 02:10:29,640
"We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat."

3584
02:10:29,640 --> 02:10:30,480
"George!"

3585
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:31,960
"Only joking, Mom."

3586
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:33,560
The train began to move.

3587
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:36,280
Harry saw the boys' mother 
waving and their sister,

3588
02:10:36,280 --> 02:10:37,280
half laughing,

3589
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:38,080
half crying,

3590
02:10:38,080 --> 02:10:41,480
running to keep up with the train 
until it gathered too much speed,

3591
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:43,480
then she fell back and waved.

3592
02:10:43,480 --> 02:10:47,480
Harry watched the girl and her mother 
disappear as the train rounded the corner.

3593
02:10:47,480 --> 02:10:49,520
Houses flashed past the window.

3594
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:51,240
Harry felt a great leap of excitement.

3595
02:10:51,760 --> 02:10:54,640
He didn't know what he was going 
to but it had to be better than

3596
02:10:54,640 --> 02:10:56,400
what he was leaving behind.

3597
02:10:56,400 --> 02:11:00,680
The door of the compartment slid open 
and the youngest redheaded boy came in.

3598
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:01,880
"Anyone sitting there?"

3599
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:04,760
he asked, pointing at the seat opposite Harry.

3600
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:06,320
"Everywhere else is full."

3601
02:11:06,320 --> 02:11:08,840
Harry shook his head and the boy sat down.

3602
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:11,840
He glanced at Harry and then 
looked quickly out of the window,

3603
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:13,400
pretending he hadn't looked.

3604
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:16,440
Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.

3605
02:11:16,440 --> 02:11:17,720
"Hey, Ron."

3606
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,120
The twins were back.

3607
02:11:19,120 --> 02:11:21,520
"Listen, we're going down 
the middle of the train ,

3608
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:24,480
Lee Jordan's got a giant tarantula down there."

3609
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:24,880
"Right,"

3610
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:26,040
mumbled Ron.

3611
02:11:26,040 --> 02:11:26,640
"Harry,"

3612
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:27,800
said the other twin,

3613
02:11:27,800 --> 02:11:29,560
"did we introduce ourselves?

3614
02:11:29,560 --> 02:11:31,800
Fred and George Weasley.

3615
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:33,040
And this is Ron,

3616
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:34,040
our brother.

3617
02:11:34,040 --> 02:11:35,320
See you later, then.

3618
02:11:35,320 --> 02:11:35,600
"Bye,"

3619
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:37,000
said Harry and Ron.

3620
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:40,320
The twins slid the compartment 
door shut behind them.

3621
02:11:40,320 --> 02:11:41,880
"Are you really Harry Potter?"

3622
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:43,160
Ron blurted out.

3623
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:44,360
Harry nodded.

3624
02:11:44,360 --> 02:11:49,000
"Oh -well, I thought it might be one 
of Fred and George's jokes," said Ron.

3625
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,480
"And have you really got , you know..."

3626
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:53,320
He pointed at Harry's forehead.

3627
02:11:53,320 --> 02:11:57,320
Harry pulled back his bangs to show 
the lightning scar. Ron stared.

3628
02:11:57,320 --> 02:11:58,880
"So that's where You-Know-Who

3629
02:11:58,880 --> 02:11:59,320
"Yes,"

3630
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:00,120
said Harry,

3631
02:12:00,120 --> 02:12:01,680
"but I can't remember it."

3632
02:12:01,680 --> 02:12:02,280
"Nothing?"

3633
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:03,800
said Ron eagerly.

3634
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:07,480
"Well , I remember a lot of 
green light, but nothing else."

3635
02:12:07,480 --> 02:12:08,640
"Wow," said Ron.

3636
02:12:08,640 --> 02:12:11,160
He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments,

3637
02:12:11,160 --> 02:12:14,040
then, as though he had suddenly 
realized what he was doing,

3638
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:16,160
he looked quickly out of the window again.

3639
02:12:16,160 --> 02:12:17,880
"Are all your family wizards?"

3640
02:12:17,880 --> 02:12:21,520
asked Harry, who found Ron just 
as interesting as Ron found him.

3641
02:12:21,520 --> 02:12:24,000
"Er , Yes, I think so," said Ron.

3642
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,600
"I think Mom's got a second 
cousin who's an accountant,

3643
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:28,200
but we never talk about him."

3644
02:12:28,200 --> 02:12:30,680
"So you must know loads of magic already."

3645
02:12:30,680 --> 02:12:34,560
The Weasleys were clearly one of those 
old wizarding families the pale boy

3646
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:36,520
in Diagon Alley had talked about.

3647
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:39,080
"I heard you went to live with Muggles," said Ron.

3648
02:12:39,080 --> 02:12:40,240
"What are they like?"

3649
02:12:40,240 --> 02:12:41,520
"Horrible -well,

3650
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:42,640
not all of them.

3651
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:44,880
My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though.

3652
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:47,040
Wish I'd had three wizard brothers."

3653
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:47,400
"Five,"

3654
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:50,640
said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy.

3655
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:53,280
"I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts.

3656
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,600
You could say I've got a lot to live up to.

3657
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:57,440
Bill and Charlie have already left ,

3658
02:12:57,440 --> 02:13:00,280
Bill was head boy and Charlie 
was captain of Quidditch.

3659
02:13:00,280 --> 02:13:02,600
Now Percy's a prefect.

3660
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:04,680
Fred and George mess around a lot,

3661
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:08,520
but they still get really good marks and 
everyone thinks they're really funny.

3662
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:11,080
Everyone expects me to do as well as the others,

3663
02:13:11,080 --> 02:13:11,880
but if I do,

3664
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:13,120
it's no big deal,

3665
02:13:13,120 --> 02:13:14,680
because they did it first.

3666
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:16,120
You never get anything new,

3667
02:13:16,120 --> 02:13:18,040
either, with five brothers.

3668
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:19,640
I've got Bill's old robes,

3669
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:20,840
Charlie's old wand,

3670
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:22,320
and Percy's old rat."

3671
02:13:22,320 --> 02:13:25,840
Ron reached inside his jacket 
and pulled out a fat gray rat,

3672
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:27,080
which was asleep.

3673
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:29,120
"His name's Scabbers and he's useless,

3674
02:13:29,120 --> 02:13:30,760
he hardly ever wakes up.

3675
02:13:30,760 --> 02:13:33,760
Percy got an owl from my dad 
for being made a prefect,

3676
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:34,920
but they couldn't aff ,

3677
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:37,400
I mean, I got Scabbers instead."

3678
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:38,920
Ron's ears went pink.

3679
02:13:38,920 --> 02:13:41,000
He seemed to think he'd said too much,

3680
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,400
because he went back to staring out of the window.

3681
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:47,480
Harry didn't think there was anything 
wrong with not being able to afford an owl.

3682
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:51,080
After all, he'd never had any money 
in his life until a month ago,

3683
02:13:51,080 --> 02:13:52,400
and he told Ron so,

3684
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:57,000
all about having to wear Dudley's old clothes 
and never getting proper birthday presents.

3685
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,600
This seemed to cheer Ron up. "...

3686
02:13:58,600 --> 02:14:00,120
and until Hagrid told me,

3687
02:14:00,120 --> 02:14:04,880
I didn't know anything about be ing a 
wizard or about my parents or Voldemort"

3688
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:06,120
Ron gasped.

3689
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:06,320
"What?"

3690
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:07,400
said Harry.

3691
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:09,040
"You said You-Know-Who's name!"

3692
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:12,040
said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed.

3693
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:14,320
"I'd have thought you, of all people , "

3694
02:14:14,320 --> 02:14:17,560
"I'm not trying to be brave 
or anything, saying the name,"

3695
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:18,480
said Harry,

3696
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,120
I just never knew you shouldn't.

3697
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:21,320
See what I mean?

3698
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:22,880
I've got loads to learn....

3699
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:24,320
I bet, " he added,

3700
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:27,480
voicing for the first time something 
that had been worrying him a lot lately,

3701
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:27,840
"

3702
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,800
I bet I'm the worst in the class."

3703
02:14:29,800 --> 02:14:30,840
"You won't be.

3704
02:14:30,840 --> 02:14:34,880
There's loads of people who come from Muggle 
families and they learn quick enough."

3705
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:36,040
While they had been talking,

3706
02:14:36,040 --> 02:14:38,240
the train had carried them out of London.

3707
02:14:38,240 --> 02:14:41,320
Now they were speeding past 
fields full of cows and sheep.

3708
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:42,840
They were quiet for a time,

3709
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:45,240
watching the fields and lanes flick past.

3710
02:14:45,240 --> 02:14:49,000
Around half past twelve there was a 
great clattering outside in the corridor

3711
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,120
and a smiling,

3712
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:52,800
dimpled woman slid back their door and said,

3713
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:55,040
"Anything off the cart, dears?"

3714
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:57,160
Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast,

3715
02:14:57,160 --> 02:14:58,320
leapt to his feet,

3716
02:14:58,320 --> 02:15:02,360
but Ron's ears went pink again and he 
muttered that he'd brought sandwiches.

3717
02:15:02,360 --> 02:15:04,240
Harry went out into the corridor.

3718
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:07,440
He had never had any money 
for candy with the Dursleys,

3719
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:09,520
and now that he had pockets rattling with gold

3720
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:13,520
and silver he was ready to buy as 
many Mars Bars as he could carry ,

3721
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:15,680
but the woman didn't have Mars Bars.

3722
02:15:15,680 --> 02:15:18,240
What she did have were Bettie 
Bott's Every Flavor Beans,

3723
02:15:18,240 --> 02:15:20,000
Drooble's Best Blowing Gum,

3724
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:21,400
Chocolate Frogs.

3725
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:22,560
Pumpkin Pasties,

3726
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:23,520
Cauldron Cakes,

3727
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,640
Licorice Wands,

3728
02:15:24,640 --> 02:15:28,360
and a number of other strange things 
Harry had never seen in his life.

3729
02:15:28,360 --> 02:15:29,840
Not wanting to miss anything,

3730
02:15:29,840 --> 02:15:34,480
he got some of everything and paid the woman 
eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.

3731
02:15:34,480 --> 02:15:37,600
Ron stared as Harry brought it 
all back in to the compartment

3732
02:15:37,600 --> 02:15:39,640
and tipped it onto an empty seat.

3733
02:15:39,640 --> 02:15:41,160
"Hungry, are you?"

3734
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:41,640
"Starving,"

3735
02:15:41,640 --> 02:15:45,120
said Harry, taking a large 
bite out of a pumpkin pasty.

3736
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:48,160
Ron had taken out a lumpy 
package and unwrapped it.

3737
02:15:48,160 --> 02:15:50,160
There were four sandwiches inside.

3738
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:52,280
He pulled one of them apart and said,

3739
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:54,840
"She always forgets I don't like corned beef."

3740
02:15:54,840 --> 02:15:56,200
"Swap you for one of these,"

3741
02:15:56,200 --> 02:15:58,520
said Harry, holding up a pasty.

3742
02:15:58,520 --> 02:15:59,160
"Go on , "

3743
02:15:59,160 --> 02:16:02,120
"You don't want this, it's all dry," said Ron.

3744
02:16:02,120 --> 02:16:04,040
"She hasn't got much time,"

3745
02:16:04,040 --> 02:16:05,000
he added quickly,

3746
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:07,000
"you know, with five of us."

3747
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:08,880
"Go on, have a pasty,"

3748
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:09,720
said Harry,

3749
02:16:09,720 --> 02:16:12,720
who had never had anything to share before or,

3750
02:16:12,720 --> 02:16:15,120
indeed, anyone to share it with.

3751
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:16,320
It was a nice feeling,

3752
02:16:16,320 --> 02:16:17,520
sitting there with Ron,

3753
02:16:17,520 --> 02:16:19,920
eating their way through all Harry's pasties,

3754
02:16:19,920 --> 02:16:23,280
cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).

3755
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:24,280
"What are these?"

3756
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:27,760
Harry asked Ron, holding up 
a pack of Chocolate Frogs.

3757
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:29,800
"They're not really frogs, are they?"

3758
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:32,520
He was starting to feel that 
nothing would surprise him.

3759
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:33,720
"No," said Ron.

3760
02:16:33,720 --> 02:16:36,680
"But see what the card is. I'm missing Agrippa."

3761
02:16:36,680 --> 02:16:37,480
"What?"

3762
02:16:37,479 --> 02:16:38,639
"Oh, of course,

3763
02:16:38,640 --> 02:16:39,620
you wouldn't know ,

3764
02:16:39,620 --> 02:16:41,161
Chocolate Frogs have cards,

3765
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:41,960
inside them,

3766
02:16:41,960 --> 02:16:43,280
you know, to collect ,

3767
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:45,080
famous witches and wizards.

3768
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:46,600
I've got about five hundred,

3769
02:16:46,600 --> 02:16:48,640
but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy."

3770
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:51,640
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate 
Frog and picked up the card.

3771
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:53,241
It showed a man's face.

3772
02:16:53,240 --> 02:16:54,760
He wore half- moon glasses,

3773
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:55,600
had a long,

3774
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:56,560
crooked nose,

3775
02:16:56,560 --> 02:16:58,161
and flowing silver hair,

3776
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,040
beard, and mustache.

3777
02:17:00,040 --> 02:17:03,000
Underneath the picture was 
the name Albus Dumbledore.

3778
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,280
"So this is Dumbledore!"

3779
02:17:04,280 --> 02:17:05,240
said Harry.

3780
02:17:05,240 --> 02:17:07,519
"Don't tell me you'd never heard of Dumbledore!"

3781
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:12,081
said Ron. "Can I have a frog? 
I might get Agrippa , thanks

3782
02:17:12,080 --> 02:17:14,680
Harry turned over his card and read:

3783
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:16,160
ALBUS DUMBLEDORE

3784
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:18,319
CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS

3785
02:17:18,319 --> 02:17:21,840
Considered by many the greatest 
wizard of modern times,

3786
02:17:21,840 --> 02:17:27,560
Dumbledore is particularly famous for his 
defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945,

3787
02:17:27,560 --> 02:17:30,960
for the discovery of the 
twelve uses of dragon's blood,

3788
02:17:30,960 --> 02:17:33,080
and his work on alchemy with his partner,

3789
02:17:33,080 --> 02:17:34,439
Nicolas Flamel.

3790
02:17:34,439 --> 02:17:37,960
Professor Dumbledore enjoys 
chamber music and tenpin bowling.

3791
02:17:37,960 --> 02:17:40,439
Harry turned the card back over and saw,

3792
02:17:40,439 --> 02:17:41,679
to his astonishment,

3793
02:17:41,680 --> 02:17:43,920
that Dumbledore's face had disappeared.

3794
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:45,080
"He's gone!"

3795
02:17:45,080 --> 02:17:48,479
"Well, you can't expect him to 
hang around all day," said Ron.

3796
02:17:48,479 --> 02:17:50,200
"He'll be back.

3797
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:53,639
No, I've got Morgana again and 
I've got about six of her...

3798
02:17:53,640 --> 02:17:54,560
do you want it?

3799
02:17:54,560 --> 02:17:55,920
You can start collecting."

3800
02:17:55,920 --> 02:17:59,920
Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of 
Chocolate Frogs waiting to be unwrapped.

3801
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:00,880
"Help yourself,"

3802
02:18:00,880 --> 02:18:01,840
said Harry.

3803
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:06,880
"But in, you know, the Muggle world, 
people just stay put in photos."

3804
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:09,359
"Do they? What, they don't move at all?"

3805
02:18:09,359 --> 02:18:10,960
Ron sounded amazed.

3806
02:18:10,960 --> 02:18:11,720
"weird!"

3807
02:18:11,720 --> 02:18:15,040
Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled 
back into the picture on his card

3808
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:17,120
and gave him a small smile.

3809
02:18:17,120 --> 02:18:20,599
Ron was more interested in eating the 
frogs than looking at the Famous Witches

3810
02:18:20,600 --> 02:18:21,960
and Wizards cards,

3811
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:24,200
but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them.

3812
02:18:24,200 --> 02:18:26,840
Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana,

3813
02:18:26,840 --> 02:18:28,240
but Hengist of Woodcroft,

3814
02:18:28,240 --> 02:18:29,439
Alberic Grunnion,

3815
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:31,280
Circe, Paracelsus,

3816
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:32,280
and Merlin.

3817
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:35,399
He finally tore his eyes away 
from the druidess Cliodna,

3818
02:18:35,399 --> 02:18:36,839
who was scratching her nose,

3819
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:40,000
to open a bag of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

3820
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,479
"You want to be careful with those,"

3821
02:18:41,479 --> 02:18:42,879
Ron warned Harry.

3822
02:18:42,880 --> 02:18:44,280
"When they say every flavor,

3823
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:45,679
they mean every flavor ,

3824
02:18:45,680 --> 02:18:50,120
you know, you get all the ordinary ones like 
chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade,

3825
02:18:50,120 --> 02:18:52,920
but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe.

3826
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:55,640
George reckons he had a 
booger- flavored one once."

3827
02:18:55,640 --> 02:18:57,360
Ron picked up a green bean,

3828
02:18:57,359 --> 02:18:58,479
looked at it carefully,

3829
02:18:58,479 --> 02:18:59,959
and bit into a corner.

3830
02:18:59,960 --> 02:19:02,319
"Bleaaargh , see? Sprouts."

3831
02:19:02,319 --> 02:19:05,000
They had a good time eating 
the Every Flavor Beans.

3832
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,080
Harry got toast,

3833
02:19:06,080 --> 02:19:07,840
coconut, baked bean,

3834
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:08,800
strawberry,

3835
02:19:08,800 --> 02:19:10,280
curry, grass,

3836
02:19:10,280 --> 02:19:11,960
coffee, sardine,

3837
02:19:11,960 --> 02:19:15,960
and was even brave enough to nibble the end 
off a funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch,

3838
02:19:15,960 --> 02:19:17,720
which turned out to be pepper.

3839
02:19:17,720 --> 02:19:21,440
The countryside now flying past 
the window was becoming wilder.

3840
02:19:21,439 --> 02:19:23,120
The neat fields had gone.

3841
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:24,080
Now there were woods,

3842
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:25,160
twisting rivers,

3843
02:19:25,160 --> 02:19:26,720
and dark green hills.

3844
02:19:26,720 --> 02:19:28,760
There was a knock on the door of their compartment

3845
02:19:28,760 --> 02:19:33,480
and the round-faced boy Harry had passed 
on platform nine and threequarters came in.

3846
02:19:33,479 --> 02:19:34,759
He looked tearful.

3847
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:35,281
"Sorry,"

3848
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:37,759
he said, "but have you seen a toad at all?"

3849
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,480
When they shook their heads, he wailed,

3850
02:19:39,479 --> 02:19:42,120
"I've lost him! He keeps getting away from me!"

3851
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:43,080
"He'll turn up,"

3852
02:19:43,080 --> 02:19:44,280
said Harry.

3853
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:44,840
"Yes,"

3854
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:46,360
said the boy miserably.

3855
02:19:46,359 --> 02:19:48,599
"Well, if you see him..." He left.

3856
02:19:48,600 --> 02:19:50,800
"Don't know why he's so bothered," said Ron.

3857
02:19:50,800 --> 02:19:53,680
"If I'd brought a toad I'd 
lose it as quick as I could.

3858
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:55,480
Mind you, I brought Scabbers,

3859
02:19:55,479 --> 02:19:56,879
so I can't talk."

3860
02:19:56,880 --> 02:19:59,280
The rat was still snoozing on Ron's lap.

3861
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:01,479
"He might have died and you 
wouldn't know the difference,"

3862
02:20:01,479 --> 02:20:03,000
said Ron in disgust.

3863
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:06,280
"I tried to turn him yellow yesterday 
to make him more interesting,

3864
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:07,880
but the spell didn't work.

3865
02:20:07,880 --> 02:20:08,680
I'll show you,

3866
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:09,640
look..."

3867
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:14,080
He rummaged around in his trunk and 
pulled out a very battered-looking wand.

3868
02:20:14,080 --> 02:20:17,479
It was chipped in places and something 
white was glinting at the end.

3869
02:20:17,479 --> 02:20:20,919
"Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway

3870
02:20:20,920 --> 02:20:24,680
He had just raised his 'wand when 
the compartment door slid open again.

3871
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:26,320
The toadless boy was back,

3872
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:28,280
but this time he had a girl with him.

3873
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:31,160
She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.

3874
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:34,599
"Has anyone seen a toad? 
Neville's lost one," she said.

3875
02:20:34,600 --> 02:20:36,400
She had a bossy sort of voice,

3876
02:20:36,399 --> 02:20:37,960
lots of bushy brown hair,

3877
02:20:37,960 --> 02:20:39,800
and rather large front teeth.

3878
02:20:39,800 --> 02:20:41,840
"We've already told him we haven't seen it,"

3879
02:20:41,840 --> 02:20:44,280
said Ron, but the girl wasn't listening,

3880
02:20:44,280 --> 02:20:46,679
she was looking at the wand in his hand.

3881
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:49,720
"Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then."

3882
02:20:49,720 --> 02:20:52,560
She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.

3883
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:54,081
"Er , all right."

3884
02:20:54,080 --> 02:20:55,519
He cleared his throat.

3885
02:20:55,520 --> 02:21:00,480
"Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, 
Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow."

3886
02:21:00,479 --> 02:21:01,799
He waved his wand,

3887
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,120
but nothing happened.

3888
02:21:03,120 --> 02:21:05,760
Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.

3889
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,480
"Are you sure that's a real spell?"

3890
02:21:07,479 --> 02:21:08,679
said the girl.

3891
02:21:08,680 --> 02:21:11,120
"Well, it's not very good, is it?

3892
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:14,880
I've tried a few simple spells just for 
practice and it's all worked for me.

3893
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,960
Nobody in my family's magic at all,

3894
02:21:16,960 --> 02:21:19,480
it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter,

3895
02:21:19,479 --> 02:21:21,000
but I was ever so pleased,

3896
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:22,520
of course, I mean,

3897
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:25,161
it's the very best school of witchcraft there is,

3898
02:21:25,160 --> 02:21:25,920
I've heard ,

3899
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,200
I've learned all our course books by heart,

3900
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:30,760
of course, I just hope it will be enough ,

3901
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:32,160
I'm Hermione Granger,

3902
02:21:32,160 --> 02:21:32,760
by the way,

3903
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:33,720
who are you.

3904
02:21:33,720 --> 02:21:35,840
She said all this very fast.

3905
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:37,160
Harry looked at Ron,

3906
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:38,319
and was relieved to see

3907
02:21:38,319 --> 02:21:42,639
by his stunned face that he hadn't learned 
all the course books by heart either.

3908
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:43,680
"I'm Ron Weasley,"

3909
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:44,760
Ron muttered.

3910
02:21:44,760 --> 02:21:45,680
"Harry Potter,"

3911
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:46,680
said Harry.

3912
02:21:46,680 --> 02:21:47,720
"Are you really?"

3913
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:48,880
said Hermione.

3914
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:49,920
"I know all about you,

3915
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:50,760
of course ,

3916
02:21:50,760 --> 02:21:52,120
I got a few extra books.

3917
02:21:52,120 --> 02:21:53,599
for background reading,

3918
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:55,520
and you're in Modern Magical History

3919
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:57,480
and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts

3920
02:21:57,479 --> 02:22:00,319
and Great Wizarding Events 
of the Twentieth Century.

3921
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:01,040
"Am I?"

3922
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:03,040
said Harry, feeling dazed.

3923
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:04,600
"Goodness, didn't you know,

3924
02:22:04,600 --> 02:22:07,241
I'd have found out everything 
I could if it was me,"

3925
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:08,359
said Hermione.

3926
02:22:08,359 --> 02:22:10,359
"Do either of you know what house you'll be in?

3927
02:22:10,359 --> 02:22:11,679
I've been asking around,

3928
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:13,201
and I hope I'm in Gryffindor,

3929
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:15,000
it sounds by far the best;

3930
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,319
I hear Dumbledore himself was in it,

3931
02:22:17,319 --> 02:22:20,120
but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad....

3932
02:22:20,120 --> 02:22:23,399
Anyway, we'd better go and 
look for Neville's toad.

3933
02:22:23,399 --> 02:22:24,639
You two had better change,

3934
02:22:24,640 --> 02:22:27,161
you know, I expect we'll be there soon."

3935
02:22:27,160 --> 02:22:29,840
And she left, taking the toadless boy with her.

3936
02:22:29,840 --> 02:22:32,080
"Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,"

3937
02:22:32,080 --> 02:22:35,760
said Ron. He threw his wand back into his trunk.

3938
02:22:35,760 --> 02:22:39,200
"Stupid spell , George gave it 
to me, bet he knew it was a dud."

3939
02:22:39,200 --> 02:22:40,760
"What house are your brothers in?"

3940
02:22:40,760 --> 02:22:41,760
asked Harry.

3941
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:42,560
"Gryffindor,"

3942
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:45,760
said Ron. Gloom seemed to 
be settling on him again.

3943
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:47,800
"Mom and Dad were in it, too.

3944
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:49,760
I don't know what they'll say if I'm not.

3945
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:52,400
I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad,

3946
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:54,559
but imagine if they put me in Slytherin."

3947
02:22:54,560 --> 02:22:58,201
"That's the house Vol-, I 
mean, You-Know-Who was in?"

3948
02:22:58,200 --> 02:22:58,479
"Yeah,"

3949
02:22:58,479 --> 02:23:02,359
said Ron. He flopped back into 
his seat, looking depressed.

3950
02:23:02,359 --> 02:23:05,799
"You know, I think the ends of 
Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,"

3951
02:23:05,800 --> 02:23:08,880
said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind off houses.

3952
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:12,280
"So what do your oldest brothers 
do now that they've left, anyway?"

3953
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:15,319
Harry was wondering what a wizard 
did once he'd finished school.

3954
02:23:15,319 --> 02:23:17,679
"Charlie's in Romania studying dragons,

3955
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:20,160
and Bill's in Africa doing 
something for Gringotts,"

3956
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:22,880
said Ron. "Did you hear about Gringotts?

3957
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:24,760
It's been all over the Daily Prophet,

3958
02:23:24,760 --> 02:23:27,640
but I don't suppose you 
get that with the Muggles ,

3959
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:30,000
someone tried to rob a high security vault."

3960
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:31,240
Harry stared.

3961
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:33,200
"Really? What happened to them?"

3962
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:35,559
"Nothing, that's why it's such big news.

3963
02:23:35,560 --> 02:23:37,040
They haven't been caught.

3964
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:41,359
My dad says it must've been a powerful 
Dark wizard to get round Gringotts,

3965
02:23:41,359 --> 02:23:43,040
but they don't think they took anything,

3966
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:44,200
that's what's odd.

3967
02:23:44,200 --> 02:23:48,800
'Course, everyone gets scared when something like 
this happens in case You-Know-Who's behind it."

3968
02:23:48,800 --> 02:23:51,160
Harry turned this news over in his mind.

3969
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:54,720
He was starting to get a prickle of fear 
every time You- Know-Who was mentioned.

3970
02:23:54,720 --> 02:23:57,840
He supposed this was all part 
of entering the magical world,

3971
02:23:57,840 --> 02:23:59,920
but it had been a lot more comfortable saying

3972
02:23:59,920 --> 02:24:00,880
"Voldemort"

3973
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:02,040
without worrying.

3974
02:24:02,040 --> 02:24:04,560
"What's your Quidditch team?" Ron asked.

3975
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:06,400
"Er , I don't know any,"

3976
02:24:06,399 --> 02:24:07,759
Harry confessed.

3977
02:24:07,760 --> 02:24:08,240
"What!"

3978
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:09,880
Ron looked dumbfounded.

3979
02:24:09,880 --> 02:24:12,960
"Oh, you wait, it's the best game in the world , "

3980
02:24:12,960 --> 02:24:14,040
And he was off,

3981
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:17,800
explaining all about the four balls 
and the positions of the seven players,

3982
02:24:17,800 --> 02:24:21,680
describing famous games he'd been to with his 
brothers and the broomstick he'd like to get

3983
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:22,880
if he had the money.

3984
02:24:22,880 --> 02:24:25,520
He was just taking Harry through 
the finer points of the game

3985
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:28,081
when the compartment door slid open yet again,

3986
02:24:28,080 --> 02:24:29,920
but it wasn't Neville the toadless boy,

3987
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:32,560
or Hermione Granger this time.

3988
02:24:32,560 --> 02:24:33,640
Three boys entered,

3989
02:24:33,640 --> 02:24:35,280
and Harry recognized the middle one

3990
02:24:35,279 --> 02:24:39,359
at once: it was the pale boy 
from Madam Malkin's robe shop.

3991
02:24:39,359 --> 02:24:43,920
He was looking at Harry with a lot more 
interest than he'd shown back in Diagon Alley.

3992
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:45,720
"Is it true?" he said.

3993
02:24:45,720 --> 02:24:49,360
"They're saying all down the train that 
Harry Potter's in this compartment.

3994
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:50,000
So it's you,

3995
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:50,319
is it?"

3996
02:24:50,840 --> 02:24:51,160
"Yes,"

3997
02:24:51,160 --> 02:24:52,120
said Harry.

3998
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:54,080
He was looking at the other boys.

3999
02:24:54,080 --> 02:24:57,000
Both of them were thickset 
and looked extremely mean.

4000
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:58,880
Standing on either side of the pale boy,

4001
02:24:58,880 --> 02:25:00,680
they looked like bodyguards.

4002
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:03,120
"Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,"

4003
02:25:03,120 --> 02:25:06,559
said the pale boy carelessly, 
noticing where Harry was looking.

4004
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:09,000
"And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy."

4005
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,560
Ron gave a slight cough,

4006
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:12,440
which might have been hiding a snigget.

4007
02:25:12,439 --> 02:25:14,120
Draco Malfoy looked at him.

4008
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:16,000
"Think my name's funny, do you?

4009
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,680
No need to ask who you are.

4010
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:20,360
My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair,

4011
02:25:20,359 --> 02:25:23,160
freckles, and more children than they can afford."

4012
02:25:23,160 --> 02:25:24,720
He turned back to Harry.

4013
02:25:24,720 --> 02:25:28,920
"You'll soon find out some wizarding 
families are much better than others, Potter.

4014
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:31,640
You don't want to go making 
friends with the wrong sort.

4015
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:32,880
I can help you there."

4016
02:25:32,880 --> 02:25:36,520
He held out his hand to shake 
Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.

4017
02:25:36,520 --> 02:25:39,360
"I think I can tell who the wrong 
sort are for myself, thanks,"

4018
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:41,000
he said coolly.

4019
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:43,040
Draco Malfoy didn't go red,

4020
02:25:43,040 --> 02:25:45,600
but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheeks.

4021
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:47,480
"I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,"

4022
02:25:47,479 --> 02:25:48,639
he said slowly.

4023
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:52,000
"Unless you're a bit politer you'll 
go the same way as your parents.

4024
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:54,439
They didn't know what was good for them, either.

4025
02:25:54,439 --> 02:25:57,439
You hang around with riffraff 
like the Weasleys and that Hagrid,

4026
02:25:57,439 --> 02:25:59,080
and it'll rub off on you."

4027
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:00,960
Both Harry and Ron stood up.

4028
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:01,840
"Say that again,"

4029
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:04,680
Ron said, his face as red as his hair.

4030
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:07,201
"Oh, you're going to fight us, are you?"

4031
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:08,559
Malfoy sneered.

4032
02:26:08,560 --> 02:26:09,720
"Unless you get out now,"

4033
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:10,560
said Harry,

4034
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:12,241
more bravely than he felt,

4035
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:15,679
because Crabbe and Goyle were 
a lot bigger than him or Ron.

4036
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:17,241
"But we don't feet like leaving,

4037
02:26:17,240 --> 02:26:18,840
do we, boys?

4038
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:21,840
We've eaten all our food and 
you still seem to have some."

4039
02:26:21,840 --> 02:26:26,120
Goyle reached toward the Chocolate 
Frogs next to Ron - Ron leapt forward,

4040
02:26:26,120 --> 02:26:28,439
but before he'd so much as touched Goyle,

4041
02:26:28,439 --> 02:26:30,359
Goyle let out a horrible yell.

4042
02:26:30,359 --> 02:26:32,799
Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger,

4043
02:26:32,800 --> 02:26:36,080
sharp little teeth sunk deep 
into Goyle's knuckle - Crabbe

4044
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:40,200
and Malfoy backed away as Goyle 
swung Scabbers round and round,

4045
02:26:40,200 --> 02:26:44,399
howling, and when Scabbets finally 
flew off and hit the window,

4046
02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:46,519
all three of them disappeared at once.

4047
02:26:46,520 --> 02:26:49,520
Perhaps they thought there were 
more rats lurking among the sweets,

4048
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:51,440
or perhaps they'd heard footsteps,

4049
02:26:51,439 --> 02:26:52,719
because a second later,

4050
02:26:52,720 --> 02:26:54,760
Hermione Granger had come in.

4051
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:55,960
"What has been going on?"

4052
02:26:55,960 --> 02:27:01,399
she said, looking at the sweets all over the 
floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.

4053
02:27:01,399 --> 02:27:02,519
I think he's been knocked out,

4054
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:06,241
" Ron said to Harry. He 
looked closer at Scabbers. "

4055
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:09,479
No , I don't believe it , 
he's gone back to sleep-"

4056
02:27:09,479 --> 02:27:10,639
And so he had.

4057
02:27:10,640 --> 02:27:12,320
"You've met Malfoy before?"

4058
02:27:12,319 --> 02:27:15,120
Harry explained about their 
meeting in Diagon Alley.

4059
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:16,240
"I've heard of his family,"

4060
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:17,559
said Ron darkly.

4061
02:27:17,560 --> 02:27:21,560
"They were some of the first to come back 
to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared.

4062
02:27:21,560 --> 02:27:23,121
Said they'd been bewitched.

4063
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:24,720
My dad doesn't believe it.

4064
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:29,000
He says Malfoy's father didn't need an 
excuse to go over to the Dark Side."

4065
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:30,479
He turned to Hermione.

4066
02:27:30,479 --> 02:27:31,879
"Can we help you with something?"

4067
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:34,520
"You'd better hurry up and put your robes on,

4068
02:27:34,520 --> 02:27:36,960
I've just been up to the 
front to ask the conductor,

4069
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:38,720
and he says we're nearly there.

4070
02:27:38,720 --> 02:27:40,760
You haven't been fighting, have you?

4071
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:43,120
You'll be in trouble before we even get there!"

4072
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:45,399
"Scabbers has been fighting, not us,"

4073
02:27:45,399 --> 02:27:47,479
said Ron, scowling at her.

4074
02:27:47,479 --> 02:27:49,439
"Would you mind leaving while we change?"

4075
02:27:49,439 --> 02:27:50,240
"All right ,

4076
02:27:50,240 --> 02:27:54,240
I only came in here because people 
outside are behaving very childishly,

4077
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:56,319
racing up and down the corridors,"

4078
02:27:56,319 --> 02:27:58,399
said Hermione in a sniffy voice.

4079
02:27:58,399 --> 02:28:01,519
"And you've got dirt on your 
nose, by the way, did you know?"

4080
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:03,360
Ron glared at her as she left.

4081
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:05,080
Harry peered out of the window.

4082
02:28:05,080 --> 02:28:06,399
It was getting dark.

4083
02:28:06,399 --> 02:28:09,759
He could see mountains and 
forests under a deep purple sky.

4084
02:28:09,760 --> 02:28:12,000
The train did seem to be slowing down.

4085
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:15,640
He and Ron took off their jackets 
and pulled on their long black robes.

4086
02:28:15,640 --> 02:28:17,400
Ron's were a bit short for him,

4087
02:28:17,399 --> 02:28:19,479
you could see his sneakers underneath them.

4088
02:28:19,479 --> 02:28:21,240
A voice echoed through the train:

4089
02:28:21,240 --> 02:28:24,240
"We will be reaching Hogwarts 
in five minutes' time.

4090
02:28:24,240 --> 02:28:26,040
Please leave your luggage on the train,

4091
02:28:26,040 --> 02:28:28,200
it will be taken to the school separately."

4092
02:28:28,200 --> 02:28:30,359
Harry's stomach lurched with nerves and Ron,

4093
02:28:30,359 --> 02:28:33,000
he saw, looked pale under his freckles.

4094
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:35,359
They crammed their pockets 
with the last of the sweets

4095
02:28:35,359 --> 02:28:38,000
and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.

4096
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,840
The train slowed right down and finally stopped.

4097
02:28:40,840 --> 02:28:43,880
People pushed their way toward 
the door and out on to a tiny,

4098
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:45,080
dark platform.

4099
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:47,160
Harry shivered in the cold night air.

4100
02:28:47,160 --> 02:28:49,840
Then a lamp came bobbing over 
the heads of the students,

4101
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:51,840
and Harry heard a familiar voice:

4102
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:56,200
"Firs' years! Firs' years over 
here! All right there, Harry?"

4103
02:28:56,200 --> 02:28:59,319
Hagrid's big hairy face 
beamed over the sea of heads.

4104
02:28:59,319 --> 02:29:00,840
"C'mon, follow me ,

4105
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:02,360
any more firs' years?

4106
02:29:02,359 --> 02:29:04,000
Mind yer step, now!

4107
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,160
Firs' years follow me!"

4108
02:29:06,160 --> 02:29:07,439
Slipping and stumbling,

4109
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:10,639
they followed Hagrid down 
what seemed to be a steep,

4110
02:29:10,640 --> 02:29:11,760
narrow path.

4111
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:16,000
It was so dark on either side of them that 
Harry thought there must be thick trees there.

4112
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,439
Nobody spoke much.

4113
02:29:17,439 --> 02:29:20,120
Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad,

4114
02:29:20,120 --> 02:29:21,720
sniffed once or twice.

4115
02:29:21,720 --> 02:29:24,600
"Ye' all get yer firs' 
sight o' Hogwarts in a sec,"

4116
02:29:24,600 --> 02:29:26,400
Hagrid called over his shoulder,

4117
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:27,920
"jus' round this bend here."

4118
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:28,800
There was a loud

4119
02:29:28,800 --> 02:29:29,600
"Oooooh!"

4120
02:29:29,600 --> 02:29:34,241
The narrow path had opened suddenly 
onto the edge of a great black take.

4121
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:36,719
Perched atop a high mountain on the other side,

4122
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:38,880
its windows sparkling in the starry sky,

4123
02:29:38,880 --> 02:29:42,040
was a vast castle with many turrets and towers.

4124
02:29:42,040 --> 02:29:43,840
"No more'n four to a boat!"

4125
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:44,840
Hagrid called,

4126
02:29:44,840 --> 02:29:48,279
pointing to a fleet of little boats 
sitting in the water by the shore.

4127
02:29:48,279 --> 02:29:51,800
Harry and Ron were followed into 
their boat by Neville and Hermione.

4128
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:52,520
"Everyone in?"

4129
02:29:52,520 --> 02:29:55,241
shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself.

4130
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,559
"Right then , FORWARD!"

4131
02:29:56,560 --> 02:29:59,201
And the fleet of little 
boats moved off all at once,

4132
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:00,599
gliding across the lake,

4133
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:02,600
which was as smooth as glass.

4134
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:03,840
Everyone was silent,

4135
02:30:03,840 --> 02:30:06,360
staring up at the great castle overhead.

4136
02:30:06,359 --> 02:30:10,519
It towered over them as they sailed nearer 
and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.

4137
02:30:10,520 --> 02:30:11,520
"Heads down!"

4138
02:30:11,520 --> 02:30:14,280
yelled Hagrid as the first 
boats reached the cliff;

4139
02:30:14,279 --> 02:30:15,439
they all bent their heads

4140
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:19,000
and the little boats carried them through 
a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening

4141
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:20,279
in the cliff face.

4142
02:30:20,279 --> 02:30:22,200
They were carried along a dark tunnel,

4143
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:24,840
which seemed to be taking them 
right underneath the castle,

4144
02:30:24,840 --> 02:30:27,200
until they reached a kind of underground harbor,

4145
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:29,960
where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.

4146
02:30:29,960 --> 02:30:32,560
"Oy, you there! Is this your toad?"

4147
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:33,560
said Hagrid,

4148
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:36,280
who was checking the boats as 
people climbed out of them.

4149
02:30:36,279 --> 02:30:37,040
"Trevor!"

4150
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:38,279
cried Neville blissfully,

4151
02:30:38,279 --> 02:30:39,840
holding out his hands.

4152
02:30:39,840 --> 02:30:43,279
Then they clambered up a passageway 
in the rock after Hagrid's lamp,

4153
02:30:43,279 --> 02:30:45,200
coming out at last onto smooth,

4154
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:47,760
damp grass right in the shadow of the castle.

4155
02:30:47,760 --> 02:30:51,000
They walked up a flight of stone 
steps and crowded around the huge,

4156
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,240
Oak front door.

4157
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:55,399
"Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?"

4158
02:30:55,399 --> 02:30:58,960
Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and 
knocked three times on the castle door.
